I really appreciate your time and I want to let you know that this is just a short \nsurvey to understand the career aspirations and the motivations of African students.\n\n00:00:20 Albert\nSo I'll be asking you some questions about your studies.\n\n00:00:26 Albert\nYour career goals and the motivations behind your choices.\n\n00:00:33 Albert\nJust. Yeah, just feel free to answer as open as you're comfortable with.\n\n00:00:39 Albert\nOK.\n\n00:00:40 Collins\nSo let's start with a little introduction about yourself.\n\n00:00:44 Collins\nMaybe your educational background\n\n00:00:45 Collins\nCan you share what program or field of study you're currently pursuing in college or\nUniversity?\n\n00:00:53 Albert\nOk I am a university student, an undergraduate\n\n00:00:59 Albert\nAt USIU, United States International University Africa, I'm taking a data science major.\n\n00:01:06\nMm.\n\n00:01:07 Albert\nBachelor of science in data science?\n\n00:01:12 Albert\nThank you so much for for that.\n\n00:01:15 Collins\nCould you tell me about the schools or institutions that you attended before college and \nhow they have influenced your current educational path?\n\n00:01:24 Albert\nIn as in per in College or before college?\n\n00:01:29 Albert\nUh.\n\n00:01:32 Collins\nBefore college really how they've influenced your current educational path? So that means \nbefore college?\n\n00:01:41 Albert\nSo I went through the 844 system where you need to work hard.\n\n00:01:46 Albert\nTo to get your mark. So you need to behave.\n\n00:01:50 Albert\nYou need to be disciplined so that you can see the goals to get the good marks which can \ntake you to the university.\n\n00:01:57 Albert\nSo you need to perform at your best and avoid so many peer pressure.\n\n00:02:02 Albert\nTo be able to.\n\n00:02:05 Albert\nTo go to a university like the USIU Africa.\n\n00:02:09 Collins\nYes, yes.\n\n00:02:10 Albert\nYeah, I still have been motivated by so many factors.\n\n00:02:12\nThank you.\n\n00:02:15\nOK.\n\n00:02:16 Albert\nAs from family members and friends who are doing very well, and I told myself, I also need \nto do well.\n\n00:02:23\nTo.\n\n00:02:23 Albert\nBe able to be among the.\n\n00:02:23\nYou.\n\n00:02:27 Albert\nHigh in the hierarchy of those people who are successful.\n\n00:02:31 Collins\nOK, OK.\n\n00:02:33 Collins\nThank you so much for that response.\n\n00:02:38 Collins\nAlbert. And now let's talk about your future\n\n00:02:41 Collins\nWhat are your long term career goals or the kind of work that you envision yourself doing \nafter graduation?\n\n00:02:46\nThis one.\n\n00:02:47 Albert\nMy long career long term career.\n\n00:02:50 Albert\nIt lies medically on the technology and so many things like not so many things as in the \ntechnological view I want to make a difference in the society.\n\n00:03:04 Albert\nOf where people are comfortable in using these gadgets, you know, not so many people \nknow how to use these gadgets. And also I want to be a successful entrepreneur.\n\n\n00:03:15 Albert\nWhere I offer others opportunities to get jobs and also i offer I I start a program where \nfunding program where I help those needy children who need to get.\n\n00:03:30 Albert\nTo study and achieve their goal. So not so many people lucky to be.\n\n00:03:36 Albert\nGo out there at university.\n\n00:03:38 Albert\nSo they need help to achieve their goals because of their background where they come \nfrom, where their, how they brought up.\n\n00:03:49 Albert\nMm.\n\n00:03:50 Collins\nThank.\n\n00:03:50 Collins\nThank you for that\n\n00:03:51 Collins\nGood response. And how about?\n\n00:03:55 Collins\nSome short term goals that you have to help you get your dream or desired career?\n\n00:04:01 Albert\nMy short term goals is to be able to to get place to to places where I'm able to.\n\n00:04:09 Albert\nSharpen myself on this that data science skills where\n\n00:04:12 Albert\nI'm able to do.\n\n00:04:13 Albert\ndata visualization I'm able to do.\n\n00:04:16 Albert\nWork on raw data,\n\n00:04:18 Albert\nClean the data so this I need small jobs like not like.\n\n00:04:25 Albert\nIt's not like an internship but\n\n00:04:28 Albert\nA way on where you can make yourself good, make myself good to be able to do what I need \nto do to be a successful data scientist or data engineer. Whichever word you can use as for\nData science because it's it's so wide.\n\n00:04:46 Albert\nIt's big.\n\n00:04:48 Collins\nYeah, I know.\n\n00:04:51 Collins\nAll right.\n\n00:04:52 Collins\nThank you for sharing that, Albert, and have these. Your goals changed over time or you've \nalways been focused on this empath?\n\n00:05:01 Albert\nSo you know.\n\n00:05:02 Albert\nKnow about data about technology. It changes every time.\n00:05:06 Albert\nYou need to be always updated.\n\n00:05:08 Albert\nSo here and there you can change and you have to change it too to be able to be on the \ncurrent ways of doing coding and so many things.\n\n00:05:19 Collins\nYes, yes.\n\n00:05:21 Collins\nOK, OK.\n\n00:05:22 Collins\nAlright, so now I'd like to understand the reasons why you chose.\n\n00:05:28 Collins\nTechnology as a as a field of of, of exploration. Rather, I'm just interested in knowing your \nmotivations and influences.\n\n00:05:35 Collins\nWhat really inspired you to choose?\n\n00:05:39 Collins\nAs data science, really.\n\n00:05:40 Collins\nAnd I'm wondering if it was really a partial or a specific experience or just other factors.\n\n00:05:48 Albert\nSo you know, so many students are asked about this question and they go straight away \nand say about job opportunities. But for me, it's not all about your opportunities. It's \nPassionate.\n\n00:06:01 Albert\nI had the passion.\n\n00:06:03 Albert\nIf you have the passion of doing something, you become comfortable with\n\n00:06:06 Albert\nYou're not working under pressure because if you do something with passion.\n\n\n00:06:12 Albert\nYou're doing it willingly without being forceful, being lazy.\n\n00:06:14\nYes.\n\n00:06:17 Albert\nSo I chose this course because I'm passionate of knowing more about coding.\n\n00:06:22 Albert\nI'm excited of knowing how I can be able to change something somewhere which can help.\n\n00:06:28 Albert\nA futuristic outcome which will be a good thing, so the.\n\n00:06:33 Albert\nMain thing that motivates me about being a.\n\n00:06:36 Albert\nScience is scientist or engineer is. I want to make a difference.\n\n00:06:41\nI.\n\n00:06:41 Albert\nWant to learn the? I want to keep on learning.\n\n00:06:45 Albert\nI want to know the difference. You know, you're not always perfect.\n\n00:06:49 Albert\nIn technology, you learn every day because it changes so fast.\n\n00:06:53 Albert\nSometimes you do not notice because the gadgets you see control.\n\n00:06:58 Collins\nYes, yes.\n\n00:07:03 Collins\nThank you so much for that response.\n\n00:07:05 Collins\nAre there people in your life, such as your family, your friends or mentors who have worked \nin the same field?\n\n00:07:13 Albert\nYeah, I have.\n\n00:07:14 Albert\nI have cousins from other little kids.\n\n00:07:19 Albert\nWho are in that line?\n\n00:07:20\nOK.\n\n00:07:23 Collins\nAnd they had an influence in your decisions.\n\n00:07:30 Collins\nHello, can you hear me?\n\n00:07:30 Albert\nWhat you doing to be disciplined except to learn to avoid other external problems?\n\n00:07:35 Albert\nPardon. OK.\n\n00:07:37 Collins\nJust go ahead please.\n\n00:07:40 Albert\nOr I was saying.\n\n00:07:45 Albert\nWe have other family members who, not most of them, but a few are at this technology \nIndustry.\n\n00:07:53 Albert\nComputer science industry.\n\n00:07:56 Albert\nAnd it's a good thing where if you.\n\n00:08:00 Collins\nOK.\n\n00:08:06 Albert\nBut if you.\n\n00:08:08 Albert\nMake yourself like you're smart. You cannot learn everything.\n\n00:08:12 Collins\nOh yeah, sure, sure.\n\n00:08:13\nYeah.\n\n00:08:13 Collins\nAll.\n\n00:08:14 Collins\nSo thank you so much for your response, Albert.\n\n00:08:18 Collins\nI'm almost completing and I'm interested in knowing if you've encountered any of role\nmodels or stories that have shaped your aspirations in the same space.\n\n00:08:28 Albert\nThere's so many role.\n\n00:08:29 Albert\nNot, but, I few, I can name a few. If you look like somebody like Bill Gates there. Yes, he he \nhas done some wonders. He is the reason why we can able to talk how we talk.\n\n00:08:45 Albert\nCan you hear me?\n\n00:08:46 Collins\nYeah, I can hear you.\n\n00:08:47 Collins\nFor that.\n\n00:08:49 Albert\nOK.\n\n\n00:08:50 Albert\nBill Gates is.\n\n00:08:52 Albert\nThe one tech.\n\n00:08:55 Collins\nYes, yes, Microsoft, the the founder of Microsoft.\n\n00:09:01 Albert\nBecause of the software you have Microsoft you have.\n\n00:09:04 Albert\nYeah, that is the main thing that makes us able to.\n\n00:09:08 Albert\nOthers, like Microsoft, invented the other part, but for me my main model is this guy.\n\n00:09:17\nOK.\n\n00:09:18 Albert\nBill Gates. OK because he.\n\n00:09:19 Albert\nHe has made this, you know, it's hard work.\n\n00:09:22 Albert\nYet he has made this Microsoft thing look.\n\n00:09:25 Albert\nSo.\n\n00:09:26 Albert\nBut it's a tough thing to make.\n\n00:09:30 Albert\nSo in the future I want to be able to be to do something of mine which can change the \n\n00:09:36 Albert\nFuture of everything\n\n00:09:38 Collins\nWow.\n\n00:09:39 Collins\nThank you for sharing that.\n\n00:09:41 Collins\nThat's really insightful and inspirational. Albert and I know the feature is very bright.\n\n00:09:47 Albert\nMm.\n\n00:09:49 Collins\nSo what are the sources of information that have helped you to make decisions around \nyour career?\n\n00:09:55 Collins\nChoice, for example, have you relied on guidance from your school counsellors, your \nfamily, the Internet, or just any other sources?\n\n00:10:05 Albert\nLiterally the main source of information to be able to do what I'm.\n\n00:10:10 Albert\nIs where I go to.\n\n00:10:11 Albert\nThe where you have been total for to do.\n\n00:10:15 Albert\nAnd apart from that source of information majorly the Internet, you can learn through \nespecially.\n\n00:10:21 Albert\nYou can teach yourself doing a few things, making taking short courses. All those short \ncourses, but majorly it's once you're being taught and being taught at the usiu.\n\n00:10:33 Albert\nThe small idea of which you know i will apply\n\n00:10:35 Albert\nthrough this other watching videos and learning for yourself and also the main factor is \npracticing.\n\n00:10:42 Albert\nIf you want to be a good technician or a tech guy, you need to be able to.\n\n00:10:47 Albert\nNeed to.\n\n00:10:47 Albert\nYou need to be disciplined.\n\n00:10:49 Collins\nYes, yes.\n\n00:10:51 Albert\nNeed to get time to be able to do it your good.\n\n00:10:55 Albert\nYourself. Be good yourself.\n\n00:10:57 Albert\nBe known as being on a good tech person as as much as you keep on practicing and keep \non learning, yeah.\n\n00:11:08 Collins\nI see.\n\n00:11:08 Collins\nThank you so much for sharing all that.\n\n00:11:11 Collins\nNow on to my last question.\n\n00:11:14 Collins\nDid you face any challenges around fatigue?\n\n00:11:18 Collins\nCan you hear me?\n\n00:11:19 Albert\nYes. Yeah, I can hear you.\n\n00:11:21 Collins\nDid you face any challenges or uncertainties when making these decisions?\n\n00:11:28 Albert\nYeah, you need obvious in life mistakes are what makes us what we are.\n\n00:11:36 Albert\nSo if you can't accept for mistakes, then you cannot.\n\n00:11:41 Albert\nShape your future.\n\n00:11:42 Albert\nMistakes are what gives us the experiences in life, because if you're not ready to be able to \nfail to answer that in the but if you take this number once together, they still they won't be \nall numbers.\n\n00:11:57 Albert\nStill be a one who will be the last one.\n\n00:12:00 Albert\nTake teachers in what we need to make mistakes so that we can learn from them.\n\n00:12:07 Albert\nSo.\n\n00:12:10 Albert\nThe main.\n\n00:12:10 Albert\nThe main boundary or the main obstacle for most of.\n\n00:12:15 Albert\nWho wants to be successful? Is being afraid to make a mistake because of the way this our \nsociety in Africa has brought us up.\n\n00:12:25 Albert\nYou feel like if we make mistakes, that's not from no one is perfect.\n\n00:12:30 Albert\nWe need to make mistakes so that you can learn.\n\n00:12:33 Albert\nYes, yes, always this the Bing something which things are tough.\n\n00:12:37 Albert\nYou make hiccups here and there, yeah.\n\n00:12:41 Collins\nThank you so much for sharing that.\n\n00:12:43 Collins\nWe've just come to the end of the interview, or rather the survey, and I'm so happy that \nyou've taken your time to listen to me and to share your thoughts. I really, really, really.\n\n\n\n"

Thank you.\n\n00:00:47\nYeah.\n\n00:00:48 Collins\nSo.\n\n00:00:49 Collins\nSo let's start with a little introduction about yourself, Arnold.\n\n00:00:54 Collins\nBasically your educational background.\n\n00:00:55 Collins\nSo could you maybe share what program or field of study you're currently pursuing in \ncollege?\n\n00:01:04 Arnold\nOK, so my name is Anand Anura.\n\n00:01:06\nI.\n00:01:06 Arnold\nAm a sophomore student studying Bachelor of Science in Nursing and Public Health.\n\n00:01:13 Arnold\nThank you.\n\n00:01:14 Collins\nAll right.\n\n00:01:16 Collins\nSo that's so.\n\n00:01:18 Collins\nAnd Arnold, good to know what you're studying.\n\n00:01:22 Collins\nSo could you tell me about the schools or institutions that you've attended before college \nand how these schools have influenced your?\n\n00:01:31 Collins\nCurrent educational path.\n00:01:35 Arnold\nSo I have attended various schools from primary.\n\n00:01:39 Arnold\nI attended Ober Boys High School Oberbaus Primary school in Amabi County.\n\n00:01:45 Arnold\nI proceeded to Kanga High School Kanga National School.\n\n00:01:50 Arnold\nWhich has been a major foundation and backbone to my current situation in campus. I \nthink my high school contributed more to the person I am today in that it molded me to a \nperson that is more resilient.\n\n00:02:04 Arnold\nAnd it helps me to gain the unwavering strength that it requires to surge around in my \nCareer.\n\n00:02:13 Arnold\nThank you.\n\n00:02:14 Collins\nThat's that's so great to hear.\n\n00:02:17 Collins\nNow let's talk about your future, and we could actually major into your career aspirations.\n\n00:02:25 Collins\nI'm really interested in knowing your long term career goals.\n\n00:02:29 Collins\nFor the kind of work that you envision yourself doing after graduation.\n\n00:02:35 Arnold\nSo I envision.\n\n00:02:39 Arnold\nBeing a global health advocate.\n\n00:02:43 Arnold\nI envision being a global health.\n\n00:02:46 Arnold\nI'm working in a career line where a lot of compassion is needed, and I realized that.\n00:02:53 Arnold\nWe are tending to get tired of compassion in the society. Yarin, fatigue, passion.\n\n00:03:02\nSo.\n\n00:03:02 Arnold\nIn a while.\n\n00:03:03 Arnold\nIs full of people undergoing a lot of trauma. People are having various problems and \nconditions which are only unveiled with these people, with this person's attitude.\n\n00:03:03 Arnold\nOf.\n\n00:03:13 Arnold\nThese patients need.\n\n00:03:15 Arnold\nCompassionate care, which at times they get they get deprived of because you realize \nmost of the health care workers are there.\n\n00:03:24 Arnold\nWorn.\n\n00:03:25 Arnold\nThey're out of energy. They don't have glucose, they don't get enough to work and so they \nget burnt out and they don't have enough energy to give compassionate care.\n\n00:03:35 Arnold\nPatient.\n\n00:03:36 Arnold\nI listen to their questions.\n\n00:03:38 Arnold\nOffering my services globally and to be a global health advocate, especially for the people \nin the reserved areas who do not get to reach for their healthcare services. When we look \nat areas such as from where I come from, I come from a place where is sickle cell.\n\n00:03:55 Arnold\nAnd patients do not get enough facilities and they don't always also get enough care.\n\n00:04:01 Arnold\nAnd so we realized that many patients die of concealed, and even where I come from, we \nhave malaria.\n\n00:04:06 Arnold\nAlso, malaria endemic area and these people do not get to know that they really \nprophylactic care.\n\n00:04:12\nOf.\n\n00:04:14 Arnold\nThis is malaria, so I envisioned to embody.\n\n00:04:18 Arnold\nA global health to global health coverage.\n\n00:04:23 Arnold\nI'm Vishal to see a place, a future, a country which the health is covered.\n\n00:04:30 Arnold\nOver not only that, those who are privileged to have enough money are the ones who are \nable to access the health services.\n\n00:04:37 Arnold\nWe have people who are really suffering. We realize that those who are coming from the \nlow income families, they have a lot of conditions which do not get to be realised because \nmost of the time they cannot, they cannot afford the health services in the hospitals.\n\n00:04:50 Arnold\nToo naive to know that.\n\n00:04:53 Collins\nYes.\n\n00:04:55 Arnold\nSo I I want to become some person.\n\n00:04:57 Arnold\nI want more to do in the society. I want to show the healthcare workers that we can still be \ncompassionate in as much that we have our problems.\n\n00:05:05 Arnold\nAre dealing with.\n00:05:07 Arnold\nI know it is so hard to be thinking about your own problems and thinking about other \npeople's problems as well. At the same time, you got to the hospital.\n\n00:05:15 Arnold\nOf them.\n\n00:05:15 Arnold\nThe patient, who is undergoing.\n\n00:05:16 Arnold\nLot of.\n\n00:05:18 Arnold\nThe patient comes present with a lot of issues.\n\n00:05:21 Arnold\nHe comes and says he has a chest pain, but when you sit and have good time with patient.\n\n00:05:27 Arnold\nWe realized that the patient has just chest pain.\n\n00:05:30 Arnold\nIt is a heart ache that this patient has. This patient has trauma.\n\n00:05:34 Arnold\nShe's breathing, traumatic, and she's piercing the heart. The patient has no one.\n\n00:05:41 Arnold\nThat is what the person I want to be a listing to listen to people and have them come.\n\n00:05:59 Collins\nHello sorry I I I lost you.\n\n00:06:01 Arnold\nHello.\n\n00:06:03 Collins\nI think it's because of connection.\n\n00:06:04 Collins\nYou continue please.\n\n00:06:08 Arnold\nWhere did you lose me exactly?\n\n00:06:12 Arnold\nWe're talking about being a lesson now.\n\n00:06:16 Arnold\nOh, I'm saying I would love to be.\n\n00:06:17 Arnold\nA singer to people.\n\n00:06:19 Arnold\nI am.\n\n00:06:20 Arnold\nWe are at a time where we are.\n\n00:06:21 Arnold\nWe are witnessing a lot of suicide being committed out here.\n\n00:06:29 Arnold\nYeah. We can see from the healthcare providers, university students, people commuting \nsuicide because no one is there to listen. And as people see it nowadays, that medicine is \nmore is a business just as any other cause, which is the wrong perception that people.\n\n00:06:48 Arnold\nWe should.\n\n00:06:49 Arnold\nWhich which makes me I want to be a.\n\n00:06:51 Arnold\nI want to be a role model to show these people that we can still be undergoing our own \ntrauma and problems and still walk people through their journey to a better life. Their \njourney to recovery from their aids.\n\n00:07:06 Arnold\nYes, thank you.\n\n00:07:08 Collins\nThat's so.\n\n00:07:10 Collins\nThat's so comprehensive.\n00:07:11 Collins\nI'm so excited to hear.\n\n00:07:14 Collins\nThe goals that you have, you know and how much you envision working for the \ncommunities that you live in.\n\n00:07:22 Collins\nSo I'll just go ahead into the second question, which is if you have any short term goals or \nsteps that you're working on to move to the desired career?\n\n00:07:35 Arnold\nYeah, of course. We we have a short, we have shorts and gold and currently I am working \nwith an organization called the Hawaii PC DN network. The young Professional Chronic \nDisease Network, Kenya.\n\n00:07:50 Arnold\nThe chapter of Kenya, which I'm the chapter leader of the Newry County so one of the \ngoals, is creating the awareness on certain diseases in the reserved areas, specifically with \nour last event was during.\n\n00:08:06 Arnold\nThe the the the Cancer Awareness month where we made awareness of cancer, the \nscreening and we we got to tell, we made short videos and clips on how someone can go \nfor screening.\n\n00:08:17 Arnold\nYeah. So those are some of the shortcomings to make awareness to people of their health \nconditions and also to talk to, to advocate for mental health, which we are planning to.\n\n00:08:28 Arnold\nVisit especially high school and campuses to have a session with students on factors \naffecting their mental health because you realize that most of this time people.\n\n00:08:40 Arnold\nHave they find it so hard?\n\n00:08:41 Arnold\nTo share with others about their problems and.\n\n00:08:44\nYes.\n\n\n00:08:45 Arnold\nDash, which is only meta femoral and they end up committing suicide as you think that is \nthe only solution towards bettering this.\n\n00:08:54 Arnold\nWhich is not the.\n\n00:08:54 Arnold\nSo we I envision a situation where.\n\n00:08:59 Arnold\nBy the end of the next year, we have some sessions on mental health talks, maybe some \nmay be placed online, some will be going physically when we get the time.\n\n00:09:11 Arnold\nTalking to these people and telling them, yeah, apparently.\n\n00:09:17 Arnold\nCause where we meet a patient you don't talk to the patient. We get to listen their side of \nthe story because you can never fully understand the situation that made someone how it \nhow the person is and what brought the person to the hospital. So some those are.\n\n00:09:30 Arnold\nOf the short time goals that I have enriching the Global health initiative.\n\n00:09:35 Collins\nWow. Wow so.\n\n00:09:36 Collins\nDo you think these your goals have changed over time or you've always been focused on?\n\n00:09:43 Arnold\nI think my goals have changed, especially this year when I got to go for my first daily \nconnotation at Noranga level 5 hospitals where I could see patients being and suffering \nwith no one there to support them.\n\n00:09:57 Arnold\nYou find, for example, relatives bring the patient and leave the patient there for you.\n\n00:10:01 Arnold\nThey don't even come to check the patient.\n\n00:10:03 Arnold\nIt really pains when you see someone on the deathbed.\n00:10:07 Arnold\nWhat? And you're at a point of helping these patients, the relatives abandoning the patient, \nand they only come when the patient has recovered.\n\n00:10:16 Arnold\nSo when I go to see how patients are continuously doing the morbidity rate of patients, \nespecially those with chronic diseases are increasing.\n\n00:10:25 Arnold\nIt really influenced my goals that these are chronic diseases are things that can be \nprevented, especially via lifestyle changes, so they don't get to be advised of their lifetime.\n\n00:10:38 Arnold\nSo this I think that really motivated me to really think that really motivated me.\n\n00:10:46 Arnold\nTo start this talk, this talks to patients on their condition.\n\n00:10:51 Arnold\nThe patient is just.\n\n00:10:52 Arnold\nThe patient knows she has cancer, but she doesn't know.\n\n00:10:55 Arnold\nTo do.\n\n00:10:55 Arnold\nShe gets panic attack and eventually she gets a she gets.\n\n00:11:00 Arnold\nA.\n\n00:11:00 Arnold\nAn anxiety disorder. Every time that she thinks that she.\n\n00:11:05 Arnold\nSo I think when I went to the hospital the first time I went to the hospital.\n\n00:11:11 Arnold\nI was found with a white pool of emotions in patients elevating.\n\n00:11:16 Arnold\nThe conditions was Hemingway, so that is one thing that really helped me, that that really \nmotivated me to be talking to people about the Primary Health care, how they can save \nthemselves from these conditions before they get them.\n\n00:11:29\nYes.\n\n00:11:30 Arnold\nYeah, now.\n\n00:11:31 Arnold\nAlthough I've always been, I've always been committed and focused in providing health \ncare. Since I joined the.\n\n00:11:39 Arnold\nSchool of Health Sciences.\n\n00:11:41 Collins\nOK.\n\n00:11:44 Collins\nNow I'd like to understand the reasons behind your career choices.\n\n00:11:49 Collins\nTalk of motivations and.\n\n00:11:52 Collins\nSo what really inspired you to choose?\n\n00:11:55\nUh.\n\n00:11:56 Collins\nYour current field of study, was it really a passion or a specific experience or just any other \nfactor?\n\n00:12:07 Arnold\nThat is a pretty interesting question.\n\n00:12:10 Arnold\nAnd I'll do that.\n\n00:12:11 Arnold\nLet me use this app.\n\n00:12:13 Arnold\nPassion comes it is passion, motivation and.\n\n00:12:17 Arnold\nHave.\n\n00:12:18 Arnold\nAlways been this person who has wanted.\n\n00:12:20 Arnold\nHelp people.\n\n00:12:21 Arnold\nI have always wanted to see people recover from their condition from their illnesses.\n\n00:12:29 Arnold\nAnd at a point when I was in high school, the time I had a broken arm and I got high, I was \nadmitted to the hospital for one week and I could see how those doctors were.\n\n00:12:34\nMm.\n\n00:12:46 Arnold\nN 0.\n\n00:12:50 Arnold\nOne day I have to position. I want to talk to people nicely. The way these people are talking \nto people I see.\n\n00:12:51\nOK.\n\n00:12:56 Arnold\nYeah, I recovered from my illness.\n\n00:13:00 Arnold\nI know this.\n\n00:13:01 Arnold\nWhere I was meant to be.\n\n00:13:02 Arnold\nI knew I was meant to.\n\n00:13:04 Arnold\nMedical profession at some point, and particularly nursing because it is the point that I get \nto have.\n\n00:13:12 Arnold\nComprehensive time with the patient.\n\n00:13:14 Arnold\nMm.\n\n00:13:16 Arnold\nYeah. So motivated by the fact that it is something that I've grown knowing that I want to be \na.\n00:13:23 Arnold\nAnd I think everyone should be having a mentor.\n\n00:13:26 Arnold\nMy mentor was always a nurse and I love the way she did her thing. The way she handled \nHerself.\n\n00:13:27\nMm.\n\n00:13:29\nOK.\n\n00:13:33\nMm.\n\n00:13:34 Arnold\nI really loved.\n\n00:13:34 Arnold\nSo I was like I need to be like this person, yes.\n\n00:13:39 Collins\nWow. Wow. Wow. So.\n\n00:13:42 Collins\nI was actually about to ask you that very same question. If you had people like mendazo, \nmaybe I worked in the similar field and how they influenced your decisions, but you just \nresponded to that and.\n\n00:13:56 Collins\nI'm so.\n\n00:13:58 Arnold\nThis to eat.\n\n00:13:59 Collins\nOK.\n\n00:13:59 Arnold\nMentally, people like.\n\n00:14:01 Arnold\nLook at someone and and.\n\n00:14:03 Arnold\nIt motivates you even though I know learning in Med school hasn't been easy to where I am \nat the point I am at now. It has a lot of bulwar.\n\n00:14:13 Arnold\nIt needs comprehensive self-discipline to be to, to, to.\n\n00:14:19 Arnold\nManeuver that, but at the point when you have a mentor, you see that this person made it.\n\n00:14:23 Arnold\nWho am I?\n\n00:14:26 Arnold\nYeah, I I haven't met. And the mentors are who are really motivated me to stay strong and \nto be at the point I am now.\n\n00:14:32 Arnold\nThank you.\n\n00:14:33 Collins\nWell, I'm just so excited to to to learn that you have mentors who who?\n\n00:14:42 Collins\nHave actually helped you shape your aspirations, especially in these critical space that has \nto deal more with human beings and their health and well-being, you know.\n\n00:14:58 Collins\nThat's so interesting, I know.\n\n00:14:59 Arnold\nYeah.\n\n00:15:00 Collins\nSo I'm just interested in the sources of information that have helped you make decisions \naround your career choice.\n\n00:15:08 Collins\nExample, if you've ever relied on maybe guidance from.\n\n00:15:12 Collins\nAre your school counselors?\n\n00:15:14 Collins\nYour family.\n\n00:15:16 Collins\nThe Internet or just other sources?\n\n00:15:21 Arnold\nCome up again.\n\n00:15:23 Collins\nI'm interested in knowing the sources of information that you've used to help you make \ndecisions around your career choice.\n\n00:15:33 Collins\nWhether it be it is a guidance from from school counsellors, be it from family or maybe the \nInternet or just other sources.\n\n00:15:44 Arnold\nOK, so I can see the family has freed up literal.\n\n00:15:50 Arnold\nIn in in in my in my in my in my journey towards my career.\n\n00:15:56 Arnold\nYeah, family majorly.\n\n00:15:58 Arnold\nReally, it's a it's a major.\n\n00:16:00 Arnold\nIt's the family where it is the backbone of all these.\n00:16:04 Arnold\nYou have someone to talk to someone and apparently I can see the people you meet.\n\n00:16:10 Arnold\nThe people you meet in in middle school, they they change it.\n\n00:16:15 Arnold\nAnd the people I have met, the friends I.\n\n00:16:17 Arnold\nMet they are they.\n\n00:16:18 Arnold\nThey are also a very good source.\n\n00:16:21 Arnold\nYeah, they have really helped me.\n\n00:16:24 Arnold\nI can tell the people I've met in my school, my family.\n\n00:16:28 Arnold\nAnd a little bit some at some point Internet, but majorly the people I meet and my family.\n\n00:16:34\nYeah.\n\n00:16:36 Collins\nSo just to the last questions, I'm wondering if you've ever faced any challenges or rather \nuncertainties when making decisions these these career decision?\n\n00:16:49 Arnold\nI have faced a lot of challenges, a lot of challenges.\n\n00:16:53 Arnold\nWe know when you're choosing a career you they're here says you here says that people \nsay that.\n\n00:16:59 Arnold\nNo.\n\n00:17:00 Arnold\nNo, you know degree nothing.\n\n00:17:03 Arnold\nYou know you're the person who's going to receive a patient who comes in accident and all \nthat blood.\n\n00:17:07 Arnold\nGoing to handle it.\n\n00:17:09 Arnold\nYou know all that you get.\n\n00:17:11 Arnold\nYou're told how hard things are, but in reality you get to realize that this is a moral vacation \nthat you're going through.\n\n00:17:18 Arnold\nBecause a lot of times either way you put up your chin.\n\n00:17:23 Arnold\nMove on with life and decide that I'm going to surgeron.\n\n00:17:26 Arnold\nGoing to have a newborn tenacity and I'm going to.\n\n00:17:29 Arnold\nIt through.\n\n00:17:32 Collins\nWow. Wow.\n\n00:17:33 Collins\nSo how have you been able to overcome all these challenges?\n\n00:17:41 Arnold\nSantander how I have been able to overcome these challenges one.\n\n00:17:47 Arnold\nIs looking at my mental. I look at my mental, I say.\n\n00:17:52 Arnold\nWow, she did it.\n\n00:17:53 Arnold\nCan do it.\n\n00:17:55 Arnold\nSecondly.\n\n00:17:58 Arnold\nI cannot let people down. A lot of people really believe in me and trust me and I cannot \nafford to let these people down.\n\n00:18:06 Arnold\nJust have to surgery.\n\n00:18:09 Arnold\nWe need a strong support system. The people around me have played a great role.\n\n00:18:15 Arnold\nIn helping me overcome the challenges.\n\n00:18:18 Arnold\nAnd I can also says.\n\n00:18:21 Arnold\nPassion with passion. You are going to defy.\n\n00:18:24 Arnold\nThe odds.\n\n00:18:25 Arnold\nThe challenges will come there, but with passion, you're going to defy all the odds, yes.\n\n00:18:32 Collins\nWell, I'm just so happy to to have you here today, Arnold, and you've shared a lot of.\n\n00:18:42 Collins\nInsights actually that are very valuable for these these research and I really appreciate the \ntime that you've taken to share your thoughts.\n\n00:18:54 Collins\nSo it's this the end of of our interview.

Thank you for having me and.\n\n00:00:57\nYeah.\n\n00:01:01\nRight.\n\n00:01:02 Collins\nThank you.\n\n00:01:02 Ascar\nI am here till you tell me. Yeah.\n00:01:06 Collins\nThank you, Oscar.\n\n00:01:08 Collins\nSo let's start with a little introduction about yourself.\n\n00:01:11 Collins\nUh.\n\n00:01:11 Collins\nMaybe you could talk about educational background.\n\n00:01:18 Collins\nCould you share some menu program or field of study?\n\n00:01:19 Ascar\nOK so.\n\n00:01:25 Ascar\nFrom primary school I just to.\n\n00:01:27 Ascar\nI am now.\n\n00:01:29 Ascar\nWe may start with the university or college.\n\n00:01:34\nOK.\n\n00:01:34 Collins\nWhat? You yeah, what you pursue right now.\n\n00:01:35 Ascar\nI am asking.\n\n00:01:38 Ascar\nI am ask I am asking university.\n\n00:01:42 Ascar\nA medical student? MB CHB.\n\n00:01:45 Ascar\nI'm currently in second year.\n00:01:48 Collins\nThat's interesting as.\n\n00:01:51 Collins\nSo could.\n\n00:01:52 Collins\nTell me about the schools or institutions that you've attended before college, and maybe \nhow they've influenced your current educational path.\n\n00:02:03 Ascar\nSo I was.\n\n00:02:05 Ascar\nI went to to primary schools.\n\n00:02:09 Ascar\nAdami.\n\n00:02:10 Ascar\nAnd then I proceeded to turn up wedding violence in Class 5.\n\n00:02:14 Ascar\nThen I completed my primary education in Tennessee also.\n\n00:02:17 Ascar\nThat's why I did my KCC examination.\n\n00:02:22 Ascar\nAnd actually I say that.\n\n00:02:24 Ascar\nAll along have actually been uninspired leader from other from.\n\n00:02:30 Ascar\nThat's when I proceeded with my leadership in high school, and that's actually moved my \nmy life.\n\n00:02:38 Ascar\nCurrently, I'm the organization secretary for the medical school.\n\n00:02:43 Ascar\nR.\n\n00:02:44 Ascar\nSo.\n\n00:02:46 Ascar\nMe. Jenny has been about leadership and trying to focus on being an all rounder person as \nmuch as we have much, much unloaded act scheduled in terms of academic and yeah \nabout our life. We should all listen back when developing ourselves.\n\n00:03:04 Ascar\nTerms of alliances, yeah.\n\n00:03:07 Ascar\nLucy.\n\n00:03:08 Collins\nAll right.\n\n00:03:08 Collins\nThat's.\n\n00:03:09 Collins\nSo you mentioned that you're currently pursuing medicine.\n\n00:03:13 Collins\nThink so?\n\n00:03:14 Collins\nAnd so I really want to know in throughout your journey, like educational journey from \nprimary to high school and now.\n\n00:03:25 Collins\nTo your college.\n\n00:03:26 Collins\nHas there been something that influenced this decision to you pursuing the medicine \ncourse that you you're currently pursuing?\n\n00:03:37 Ascar\nOK, I do see that from the.\n\n00:03:40 Ascar\nI didn't like I had. I developed my spiritual knowledge in high school all along from primary.\n\n00:03:53 Ascar\nSchool. You know something that you just.\n\n00:03:58 Ascar\nThen how we know how is an expedition within you? You know that I'll be a doctor one day, \nso I can say much of much of it was developed in high school and it was influenced by my.\n\n00:03:58\nYes.\n\n00:04:12 Ascar\nTeachers. Yeah. And my parents too.\n\n00:04:15 Ascar\nAlso having having more.\n\n00:04:18 Ascar\nI lost my grandfather when I was in home too during the COVID period due to cats and.\n\n00:04:26\nSorry about that.\n\n00:04:26 Ascar\nAt the better situation.\n\n00:04:30 Ascar\nAnd that's not actually the first.\n\n00:04:32 Ascar\nSo I heard that maybe you can try and see what's really behind this cancer thing.\n\n00:04:41 Collins\nSo sorry.\n\n00:04:4 Collins\nI'm so sorry about the loss and I'm glad to hear that.\n\n00:04:49 Collins\nYou do some of your aspirations from your teachers around, you know, and your family, \nand that would lead me to a question that I'd ask you in due course.\n\n00:05:00 Collins\nSo thank you for that response.\n\n00:05:02 Collins\nHer.\n\n00:05:03 Collins\nJust go ahead to the next question, which is to know.\n\n00:05:09 Collins\nAnd now that you're pursuing medicine, you know we've seen people going through some \ncourses and at the end of the day, they tend to do other things after graduation. You know, \nso is this what you're trying to?\n\n00:05:23 Collins\nMean. Is this the work that you're going you're envisioning yourself doing after graduation \nLike.\n\n00:05:30 Collins\nWorking in a hospital or working in your own, I mean, could you just maybe talk about that, \nPlease?\n\n00:05:40 Ascar\nThank you so.\n\n00:05:42 Ascar\nThe current interviewing is actually going to be a tough a tough one for the doctors.\n\n00:05:47 Ascar\nWe have much.\n\n00:05:49 Ascar\nWe have so many cases of people finishing their studies, then they end up in other career \npaths so.\n\n00:05:59 Ascar\nI have a thing in the field of treating patients having that patient doctor experience, but you \nknow as much as we as we go along, we realize that not everything we really want to.\n\n00:06:11 Ascar\nDo is what we want to do.\n\n00:06:13 Ascar\nLet me follow.\n\n00:06:14 Ascar\nOther things.\n\n00:06:15\nDown.\n\n00:06:15\nFor me.\n\n00:06:16 Ascar\nI'm usually working as a doctor, maybe in a public or maybe a private facility. As I said \nBefore.\n\n00:06:24 Ascar\nHaving this the last year, the finalist the finalists for the.\n\n00:06:29 Ascar\nYeah.\n\n00:06:31 Ascar\nLast are actually still outside there.\n\n00:06:33 Ascar\nNot been posted in time.\n\n00:06:34 Ascar\nYou know that before.\n\n00:06:39\nWhat?\n\n00:06:39 Ascar\nGo ahead, participate to, to, to actually be a doctor. You would have the license so.\n\n00:06:47 Ascar\nOther things.\n\n00:06:58 Ascar\nAnd having that notion of maybe working as a doctor, but in the field of medicine, not like \ndoctor, doctor, patient care maybe is some entrepreneurship.\n\n00:07:12 Ascar\nAnd.\n\n00:07:12 Ascar\nI hope to be ready for anything that can happen, but I'm hopeful.\n\n00:07:17 Ascar\nAnd that doctor, yeah.\n\n00:07:19 Collins\nAlright. Interesting interest. That's interesting ask so.\n\n00:07:24 Collins\nI'd like to know if you have any short term goals or steps that you're working on to move \ntoward these your desired career.\n\n00:07:36 Ascar\nHe shoot them girls I.\n\n00:07:38 Ascar\nThat medicine is actually so packed and having, like a whole year in school, having a one \nday sorry. A one week holiday, 2 weeks holiday and the maximum getting.\n\n00:07:52 Ascar\nTo a month would like a month and a.\n\n00:07:56 Ascar\nYou see that?\n\n00:07:57 Ascar\nYou have more of your time in school, so I think we should.\n\n00:08:02 Ascar\nLike we should be in mission to being school and having other things that along along with \nyou studies.\n\n00:08:10 Ascar\nSo actually I'm thinking of maybe which I'm thinking of studying.\n\n00:08:17 Ascar\nBecause like learning French, because may get yourself a chance in working in France and \nfor France.\n\n00:08:23 Ascar\nHave to know their language before you get to work.\n\n00:08:27 Ascar\nSo when you go, if you want to go for Father's Day, this you must know the their language, \nbecause that's what they use in school.\n\n00:08:32\nYeah, true.\n\n00:08:36 Ascar\nYeah, I studied the first book you have now is the language and mathematical enthusiast.\n\n00:08:43 Ascar\nI'm I'm also working on a mathematics course that I should have.\n\n00:08:47 Ascar\nCause. Maybe I'll get to working, maybe.\n\n00:08:52 Ascar\nYou you never know something like.\n\n00:08:56 Collins\nYeah, sure, sure. Alright.\n\n00:09:01 Collins\nThank you for that.\n\n00:09:03 Collins\nI'm.\n\n00:09:04 Collins\nYeah, I also love Watts, so I'm happy to hear that you're a mathematic mathematic \nenthusiast as well.\n\n00:09:12 Collins\nAnd so I'd really love to know if.\n\n00:09:16 Collins\nThese your goals have changed over time, or you've always been focused on these these \nImportant.\n\n00:09:31 Collins\nHello. Did you hear me?\n\n00:09:35 Collins\nHello.\n\n00:09:38 Collins\nHello.\n\n00:09:41 Collins\nHello Oscar.\n\n00:09:42 Collins\nSorry, I just experienced some.\n\n00:09:47 Collins\nTechnical hit and I unfortunately.\n\n00:09:50 Collins\nSo I left when you are when we are talking about something, right.\n\n00:09:57 Ascar\nYeah.\n\n00:09:58 Collins\nYeah. So I wanted to know if.\n\n00:10:01 Ascar\nYou're telling me?\n\n00:10:03 Collins\nSorry.\n\n00:10:04 Ascar\nYeah.\n\n00:10:05 Ascar\nYou're telling me about you being a mathematic?\n\n00:10:08 Collins\nYeah, about the mathematics emphasis as well.\n\n00:10:13 Collins\nAnd so that was leading me to, I mean the response that you gave me was leading me to \nmy third question on that part, which is if these your goals.\n\n00:10:24 Collins\nAre maybe changed over time, or they've always been?\n\n00:10:26 Collins\nYou've always been focused on these same path.\n\n\n00:10:31 Ascar\nOK so.\n\n00:10:34 Ascar\nMany goals, as they said, I've talked about having having having the interest of being a \nDoctor.\n\n00:10:42 Ascar\nI don't.\n\n00:10:42 Ascar\nFrom high school, then about the French language.\n\n00:10:47 Ascar\nActually wanted to do it as a as a subject in high school, but actually never got the \nopportunity because.\n\n00:10:54 Ascar\nI arrived late and the class was already full.\n\n00:10:58 Ascar\nWhen I bought mathematics, I had an engine.\n\n00:11:02 Ascar\nA career and he said with mathematic and then now considering I wanted to become a \ndoctor, there was no way I would be switched.\n\n00:11:11 Ascar\nBut I feel like I have that much, much passion in learning mathematics.\n\n00:11:18 Ascar\nSo.\n\n00:11:18 Ascar\nI was actually thinking about maybe doing it is another 'cause I don't know which course \nthat really entails.\n\n00:11:26 Ascar\nFor a long, maybe pure math or something.\n\n00:11:28 Ascar\nBut then I was thinking of it in from the medical field perspective.\n\n00:11:34 Ascar\nAnd I really that maybe because I'll just be having two careers, nothing like they, they won't \nleave having pure math and medicine.\n\n00:11:44 Ascar\nLet's really like I was saying because maybe I want to get to use these other career.\n\n00:11:50 Ascar\nAnyway.\n\n00:11:51 Ascar\nMaybe I'll just have it is.\n\n00:11:53 Ascar\nMy achievements, yeah.\n\n00:11:57 Ascar\nWow, OK.\n\n00:11:58 Collins\nThat's so great.\n\n00:12:01 Collins\nSo I just want to go ahead.\n\n00:12:05 Collins\nTo the the other questions which.\n\n00:12:10 Collins\nThat leads me to wanting to really understand the reasons behind your career choice.\n\n00:12:16 Collins\nSo what inspired you to choose your current field of study or career?\n\n00:12:20 Collins\nI think you mentioned something today in your family to do with one of your family's family \nMembers.\n\n00:12:28 Collins\nYou know, and also growing inspirations from the environment, which is your teachers \nAnd?\n\n00:12:36 Collins\nJust to mention of you, so was this your passion?\n\n00:12:40 Collins\nWas it really your passion?\n\n00:12:43 Collins\nOr you found other factors that really influenced your career choice.\n\n00:12:51 Ascar\nSo yeah, shouldn't.\n\n00:12:53 Ascar\nI wouldn't really say it's a such a passionate so, so much happening. You can die for.\n\n00:13:01 Ascar\nFrom the go I was just having it as a code then along the way.\n\n00:13:06\nThank you.\n\n00:13:07 Ascar\nIt's an interesting world having to deal with people understanding people.\n\n00:13:12 Ascar\nI'm a person who loves personal interaction with clients.\n\n00:13:16 Ascar\nWhat do you?\n\n00:13:17 Ascar\nWhy do you love this thing?\n\n00:13:20 Ascar\nYou have a.\n\n00:13:21 Ascar\nWhat she got this problem?\n\n00:13:23 Ascar\nIs it something you can?\n\n00:13:24 Ascar\nYou know something you can't solve, so that's mainly.\n\n00:13:28 Ascar\nWhat's?\n00:13:29 Ascar\nMe maybe having much of it.\n\n00:13:31 Ascar\nIt's interesting there going to the medical field, but then I felt like I really loved the \nmathematics more than medicine.\n\n00:13:41 Ascar\nFrom from the go at least.\n\n00:13:46 Ascar\nHaving to decide whether to go for medicine because medicine.\n\n00:13:49 Ascar\nThat.\n\n00:13:51 Ascar\nHaving person to person interaction, but mathematics is something when I sit down.\n\n00:13:56 Ascar\nDo it.\n\n00:13:56 Ascar\nBut I actually love it. I can go for all day just trying to find a solution to a sandwich I don't \neven want to help me anywhere.\n\n00:14:03 Ascar\nMaybe something like a get occursion?\n\n00:14:06 Ascar\nAlong the social media pages, let me just sit down to do something that is actually not \nrelated to anything you want to do. So I tell you they really love mathematics and I had had \nhaving to say whether to go for the field because I knew where they.\n\n00:14:22 Ascar\nGo for medicine.\n\n00:14:24 Ascar\nHave to be.\n\n00:14:25 Ascar\nIt has much entailed in it. It really needs to the passion that much passion to do it, and then \nfor mathematics, I wouldn't struggle with anything, so I knew.\n\n00:14:35 Ascar\nGood for the middle.\n\n00:14:37 Ascar\nPhilip, I have to have passion.\n\n00:14:40 Ascar\nGive much of my ideas and everything.\n\n00:14:42 Ascar\nBut for mathematics, I would just sit down and fast and kill.\n\n00:14:47 Ascar\nThat be.\n\n00:14:48 Ascar\nAnd I'll just wait for the exam so.\n\n00:14:52 Ascar\nI'd really say about passion.\n\n00:14:56 Ascar\nBut yeah, you get those two fields together, yeah?\n\n00:14:59 Collins\nYeah, yeah. Because, you know, I've heard you mention mathematics more than you know \nof study, which is a medicine.\n\n00:15:10 Collins\nI'd say maybe the passion is more advanced, right?\n\n00:15:16 Collins\nOh, that's yeah.\n\n00:15:16 Ascar\nYeah. Let's see.\n\n00:15:19 Ascar\nFor medicine, it's about mostly environmentally.\n\n00:15:24 Ascar\nDriven like, what's the what is the environment and having that passion to push?\n\n00:15:31 Ascar\nThat even person interaction, yeah.\n\n00:15:35 Collins\nOh, OK. So well, that is where now my the other place. The other part of the question was, \nlike, these are the factors that.\n\n00:15:42 Collins\nDrove you to.\n\n00:15:45 Collins\nTo medicine because you mentioned.\n\n00:15:49 Collins\nFactors that.\n\n00:15:52 Collins\nMaybe led you to getting into medicine like the person.\n\n00:15:57 Collins\nI mean the thing that you mentioned.\n\n00:16:00 Collins\nYou have something to talk about that.\n\n00:16:05 Ascar\nYeah.\n\n00:16:06 Ascar\nSo about the factors, I'd say that.\n\n00:16:10 Ascar\nMaybe she needs something you hope to practice in the each and every day whenever you \njust look at someone you're looking at medicine.\n\n00:16:19 Ascar\nIf you have.\n\n00:16:21 Ascar\nLooking at a person from a medical perspective and.\n\n00:16:25 Ascar\nIt'd be interesting just for another person who's maybe doing something else tourism, \nlooking at a person they look at person from a perspective of whatever this person travels \nthrough Germany.\n00:16:39 Ascar\nI'll have a trip to Germany for me.\n\n00:16:41 Collins\nYeah.\n\n00:16:41 Ascar\nLook at you.\n\n00:16:43 Ascar\nI look at your hand and.\n\n00:16:46 Ascar\nThis vein is superficial way.\n\n00:16:48 Ascar\nIt's kind of interesting and it's just like for a person.\n\n00:16:50 Collins\nYeah.\n\n00:16:52 Ascar\nWho was doing something related to?\n\n00:16:54 Ascar\nYou'd have to go somewhere like a Pakistan.\n\n00:16:59 Ascar\nAirports for you to see people are bring some air, but for me I just walk out of the house.\n\n00:17:05 Ascar\nLook at a person.\n\n00:17:06 Ascar\nThat's what I'm looking.\n\n00:17:07 Ascar\nI'm studying.\n\n00:17:08 Ascar\nI look at that person, I'm studying, so it's kind of interesting.\n\n00:17:14 Ascar\nHaving to look at a person from that view, then again having that.\n00:17:20 Ascar\nHaving that passion to help people.\n\n00:17:25 Ascar\nYou see, a person is sick.\n\n00:17:26 Ascar\nBut then you feel if you should help them, but you don't know what to do, so you feel like \nthat's what. If I do it, then I'll be. I'll be the one able to help this person to get. And then I've \nmentioned about having to interact with people.\n\n00:17:38\nYeah, I am.\n\n00:17:43 Ascar\nHaving to solve some issues.\n\n00:17:45 Ascar\nLike we have issues to do with mental health, we have issues to do with.\n\n00:17:52 Ascar\nThese basic things, like a person faints and nobody knows what to do.\n\n00:17:55 Ascar\nA person is epileptic and nobody knows what to do with the person. And OK, having you \nmay have a large crowd there, but nobody really knows what to do. You you're willing to \nhave, but you don't know.\n\n00:18:08 Ascar\nSo I'd say some of the issues.\n\n00:18:11 Ascar\nThat are really around us that we don't know how to deal with them.\n\n00:18:16 Ascar\nWe are carrying videos.\n\n00:18:17 Ascar\nIt's like there's no way everything today and how that that problem it would be there \nforever.\n\n00:18:24 Collins\nYeah.\n\n00:18:25 Ascar\nAvoid it, you.\n\n00:18:26 Ascar\nYeah. So I'd say some of the issues that was on.\n\n00:18:28\nWell.\n\n00:18:30\nWow. Wow. Wow.\n\n00:18:31 Collins\nThat's so it's so interesting. And so beautiful, yeah.\n\n00:18:37\nUh.\n\n00:18:37 Collins\nJust because of.\n\n00:18:38 Collins\nI just want to maybe touch on a few other questions and then we call it a day.\n\n00:18:43 Collins\nI actually mentioned that it was supposed to take barely 10 minutes, but seemingly \nexceeded.\n\n00:18:51 Collins\nBut now, would you now have you really encountered encountered any role models or \nstories that shaped your aspirations in?\n\n00:19:00 Collins\nThese medical space.\n\n00:19:04 Ascar\nYeah. OK. We had this notion of Ben Carson when you were in Class A class for around \nthere, so.\n\n00:19:12\nMm.\n\n00:19:13 Ascar\nYou know, it's totally interesting, I'd say that is one of the inspired me then actually have a \nperson. I got to know when I was just draining medical school and she was from this Abbey \nschool. She was from an extra County School.\n\n00:19:29\nThanks.\n\n00:19:29 Ascar\nShe did medicine and she's done.\n\n00:19:32 Ascar\nNow practicing.\n\n00:19:34 Ascar\nShe's actually, yeah, she's medicine.\n\n00:19:37 Ascar\nSo you get to meet her.\n\n00:19:38 Ascar\nPassword.\n\n00:19:39 Ascar\nAnd you feel like your mental ability is more than that.\n\n00:19:43 Ascar\nFrom that you should get from an extra County School or from a National School like that. \nWhy do I feel like I'm not able to do this?\n\n00:19:47 Collins\nYes.\n\n00:19:52 Ascar\nBut actually I'd say that.\n\n00:19:52\nYeah.\n\n00:19:54 Ascar\nAt times.\n\n00:19:55 Ascar\nGet to make such changes, but you realize that the person really had passion because at \ntimes you may study medicine and you wonder if that's really what you wanted for yourself. \nYou get.\n00:20:05 Collins\nYeah, yeah, true. Well.\n\n00:20:08 Ascar\nBut.\n\n00:20:10 Collins\nInteresting.\n\n00:20:15 Collins\nWow, that's so.\n\n00:20:16 Collins\nEspecially the part where you mentioned this person comes from an an extra County \nSchool and you're from a national institution. So definitely your brain capacity is higher \nThan.\n\n00:20:30 Collins\nThis this part I mean.\n\n00:20:31 Collins\nThat's so, so interesting. Now, are there sources of information that helped you to make \ndecisions around this choice? And if there is, what other resources such as maybe guide \nGuidance?\n\n00:20:46 Collins\nTells your family discussions.\n\n00:20:49 Collins\nOnline platforms or career counseling that helps you to decide on your field of study.\n\n00:20:56 Ascar\nYeah, I actually hate these.\n\n00:20:59 Ascar\nA documentary.\n\n00:21:02 Ascar\nFrom not a documentary, an article, something this this like, maybe a university publishes \na book.\n\n00:21:09 Ascar\nSo I had this book from.\n\n00:21:12 Ascar\nTo the name of this hospital. That's what deals with.\n\n00:21:16 Ascar\nOrthopedics in in Eldoret.\n\n00:21:19\nYeah.\n\n00:21:21 Ascar\nThe name. So I had the article from that hospital and I actually learned that it's more \ninteresting. Even they deal with mainly about doing disruption and everything.\n\n00:21:32 Ascar\nGive you those metallic things and you get to walk like other people.\n\n00:21:36 Ascar\nSo I saw it from that school. That's interesting.\n\n00:21:39 Ascar\nGet to give.\n\n00:21:40 Ascar\nPerson the opportunity to walk and.\n\n00:21:44 Ascar\nAnd then having to see when you go in a.\n\n00:21:47 Ascar\nVisited which hospital?\n\n00:21:49 Ascar\nYeah. And then you encounter more people doing.\n\n00:21:54 Ascar\nIf you see people are miserable in the hospital, the vulnerable, you can't help. Yeah.\n\n00:22:02 Ascar\nGuess those are mainly and then about the only.\n\n00:22:05 Ascar\nIssues from should be channels and everything from the family. They get to tell you stories \nAbout.\n\n00:22:11 Ascar\nPerson did.\n\n00:22:12 Ascar\nThey died because of this.\n\n00:22:14 Ascar\nThen OK.\n\n00:22:17 Ascar\nLike after learning after being in medical school for something really, that was a very small \nissue and they would have solved.\n\n00:22:23 Ascar\nBut then nobody knew anything about.\n\n00:22:23\nYeah. Thank you.\n\n00:22:25 Ascar\nYeah, hello is working long. Maybe somewhere like the other day we just saw a person who \nwas actually, she was almost dying. And the people around her didn't know what was \nHappening.\n\n00:22:35 Ascar\nLost like a mother. Then she was like, fainted.\n\n00:22:40 Ascar\nAnd then the people were not aware that.\n\n00:22:43 Ascar\nThen they they laid her in their own position and she would have died actually.\n\n00:22:47 Ascar\nSwitching the person to another position and it's highly the person who makes happen. The \npeople like you're a magician the most magician is something really simple.\n\n00:22:59 Ascar\nYeah. So I'd say the inventory.\n\n00:23:00 Collins\nWell now.\n\n\n00:23:04 Collins\nThank you for sharing but.\n\n00:23:06\nOK.\n\n00:23:08 Collins\nLastly, you mentioned that you experienced some uncertainties when making your \ndecisions between your passion, which is mathematics, and your current.\n\n00:23:19 Collins\nField of study, which is a medicine.\n\n00:23:22 Collins\nHow did you overcome?\n\n00:23:23 Collins\nThese answers to answers or maybe challenges.\n\n00:23:27 Collins\nLack of a better word.\n\n00:23:31 Ascar\nOK, head to really think about it. If I've done a mathematical course, I wouldn't have the \nopportunity to to do something related to medicine because medicine itself is a very \nLargely.\n\n00:23:48 Ascar\nDoing medicine, I realize that you can have the opportunity to actually practice something \nrelated to mathematics in the fields of research.\n\n00:23:56 Ascar\nMaybe this stage measurement laboratory?\n\n00:24:01 Ascar\nI have the opportunity to to do the mathematics so medicine is a very large field and I \nrealize it can accommodate this mathematics so.\n\n00:24:11 Ascar\nAnd having to wait about what are the benefits? Much more of the benefits?\n\n00:24:17 Ascar\nMathematics. It means the interest and everything because you get to like see many things \nrelated to mathematics daily. But then you realize that.\n00:24:28 Ascar\nI'm a person who loves people, people living.\n\n00:24:30 Ascar\nWill I help them?\n\n00:24:33 Ascar\nBut everyone is passionate about math and not everyone gets to encounter. \nMathematically, they won't after their high school education, they wouldn't.\n\n00:24:43 Ascar\nLove to.\n\n00:24:44 Ascar\nCome across the mathematics but for.\n\n00:24:46 Ascar\nMedicine you will get.\n\n00:24:48 Ascar\nYou need a doctor that you encounter medicine.\n\n00:24:52 Ascar\nYou you, you lose a loved one.\n\n00:24:55 Ascar\nYou have mental issues. Many things.\n\n00:24:58 Ascar\nSo medicines are large, building it can accommodate many, many, many things.\n\n00:25:03 Ascar\nCan.\n\n00:25:06 Ascar\nYeah.\n\n00:25:07 Collins\nThank you so much for sharing your thoughts and insights with me, Oscar.\n\n00:25:15 Collins\nI'm so grateful for your time. Your insights are incredibly valuable.\n\n\n00:25:22 Collins\nFor the purposes of this research, and I'm just so beholden.\n\n00:25:28 Ascar\nThank you.\n\n00:25:29 Ascar\nYou.\n\n00:25:29 Ascar\nIt's a pleasure to have been having me and sharing my thoughts and.\n\n00:25:36 Ascar\nIt's help another person, yeah.\n\n00:25:39\nYeah.\n\n00:25:40 Collins\nThank you so much.\n\n00:25:41 Collins\nI wish you well as you continue with your studies and.\n\n00:25:46 Collins\nWe're going to talk.\n\n00:25:49 Ascar\nIt's OK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

OK.\n\n00:03:43 Collins\nThank you for answer for that response, Beth.\n\n00:03:46 Collins\t\nLet's talk about your future now.\n\n00:03:48 Collins\t\t\nWhat are your long term career goals or the kind of work that you envision yourself doing \nafter graduation?\t\n\n00:03:55 Bethuel\nOK, my long term goals is first of all I want to take a role of leadership in any of the software \nengineering companies.\n\n00:04:03 Collins\nUh.\n\n\n00:04:04 Bethuel\nMaybe become a senior engineer or technical architect in that company.\n\n00:04:10 Bethuel\nSecondly, I want to set set up my business.\n\n00:04:13\nMm.\n\n00:04:14 Bethuel\nOf basically the tech field and try to make Lambda somethings like games.\n\n00:04:20 Bethuel\nIt will generate a lot of revenue for me and the country also.\n\n00:04:25 Collins\nOK.\n\n00:04:27 Bethuel\nYeah. And also as time goes by, I want to be maybe a mentor.\n\n00:04:27 Collins\nThat sounds so great. And then?\n\n00:04:32 Bethuel\nThat I can just guide other people, the upcoming software engineer.\n\n00:04:36 Collins\nThat's so great to hear.\n\n00:04:38 Collins\nWell, thank you so much for that response.\n\n00:04:40 Collins\nDo you have any short term goals or steps that you're working on to move you toward that \ndesired career?\n\n00:04:47 Bethuel\nOK, my short term goals is first of all, master the core skills of software engineering.\n\n00:04:53 Bethuel\nMaster the programming languages such as the JavaScript MM.\n\n\n00:05:01 Bethuel\nI want to build a strong foundation.\n\n00:05:03 Bethuel\nMm.\n\n00:05:04 Bethuel\nSo that I can focus on understanding software engineering, the principles and the \nalgorithm and data structures.\n\n00:05:12 Bethuel\nYeah, I think that's all.\n\n00:05:14 Collins\nYeah, interesting. Interesting practical experience of the work.\n\n00:05:16 Bethuel\nAnd practically.\n\n00:05:19 Collins\nOK, I see.\n\n00:05:21 Collins\nYeah. Now I'm wondering if you've always been focused on this goal of doing software \nengineering or it has changed over time.\n\n00:05:32 Bethuel\nDon't exchange overtime. I won't lie.\n\n00:05:36 Bethuel\nYes.\n\n00:05:38 Collins\nAh, OK.\n\n00:05:39 Collins\nNow I'd like to understand the reason.\n\n00:05:41 Collins\nAnd your career choices like the motivations and influences.\n\n00:05:46 Collins\nSo what really inspired you to choose software engineering as a as a career path?\n\n00:05:51 Collins\nWas it a passion, a specific experience or just other factors?\n\n00:05:56 Bethuel\nWell, it's basically my passion of computers.\n\n00:06:01 Bethuel\nYeah, that's.\n\n00:06:02 Bethuel\nThat's what I said me to take on the course and see if I can learn more about the \ncomputers, because for a really long time, I really want to do things related to computers.\n\n00:06:13 Collins\nOK.\n\n00:06:14 Collins\nAnd other people in your life, such as family, friends or mentors who have worked, who \nhave worked in the same field.\n\n00:06:20 Bethuel\nYeah.\n00:06:23 Bethuel\nYes, yes, actually my cousin.\n00:06:26 Bethuel\nUh, huh. He's also doing software engineering.\n00:06:31 Bethuel\nYes.\n00:06:32 Collins\nAnd did your cousin have an influence in your decision to settle on software engineering?\n00:06:40 Bethuel\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n00:06:43 Collins\nOK, OK. Interesting. And have you encountered any role models or stories that have shaped your aspirations in this same space now?\n00:06:53 Bethuel\nFor now, I think I'll just say my cousin.\n00:06:56 Collins\nOK.\n00:06:56 Bethuel\nBecause he has really been a strong factor in me choosing this.\n00:07:00 Collins\nOK.\n00:07:02 Collins\nAnd now I'm interested in knowing the sources of information that have helped you to make decisions around your career choice. For example, have you relied on guidance from your school counsellor or...?\n00:07:15 Bethuel\nBut yeah, there are some people in my school, Desert High School.\n00:07:20 Bethuel\nUh, huh. Who guided us about a variety of courses. OK. And I think that engineering caught my eye.\n00:07:29 Bethuel\nBecause at least it could relate to the things I love, such as computers, as I've mentioned earlier.\n00:07:36 Collins\nOK.\n00:07:38 Collins\nOK. Interesting.\n00:07:41 Collins\nYeah. Well, finally, I think there's usually that temptation: Is this really the best course for me after high school?\n00:07:50 Collins\nYou know, so I'm wondering if you ever faced any challenges or uncertainties when making these decisions?\n00:07:59 Bethuel\nSo you can, could you repeat the question?\n00:08:02 Collins\nDid you face any challenges or uncertainties when making this decision to settle on software engineering?\n00:08:11 Bethuel\nNot really.\n00:08:13\nOK.\n00:08:14 Bethuel\nNot really.\n00:08:14 Collins\nYes. Ah.\n00:08:16 Collins\nSo thank you so much, Bethuel, for sharing your thoughts.\n00:08:20 Collins\nYour insights are incredibly valuable for the purposes of this...\n\n"

Yeah, before we start, do you consent to participate in the survey?\n00:01:01 Collins\nLet's start with a little introduction about yourself, John.\n00:01:05 Collins\nCan you share what program or field of study you're currently pursuing in college?\n00:01:12\nJohn\nOK.\n00:01:15 Collins\nGo ahead.\n00:01:18 John\nI assume I'm majoring in film production and directing at United States University Africa.\n00:01:30\nCollins\nThank you.\n00:01:31 Collins\nOK, great. Could you tell me about the schools or institutions that you've attended before joining college and how they have influenced your current educational path?\n00:01:45 John\nOK, before joining United States...\n00:01:49 John\nI was at Japan University where I was pursuing...\n00:01:53 John\nIn environmental planning and management.\n00:01:58 John\nYeah.\n00:02:01 Collins\nOK. Did it have an influence in you coming to USAU?\n00:02:08 John\nNo, there was no influence.\n00:02:11 John\nI mean, I think...\n00:02:12 Collins\nI mean, did it influence your current career, which is film and production?\n00:02:21 John\nNo, no it did.\nJohn\nThere was no influence from that other side.\n00:02:25 Collins\nOK.\n00:02:27 Collins\nNow let's talk about your...\n00:02:29 Collins\nWhat are your long term career goals or the kind of work that you envision yourself doing after you graduate?\n00:02:37 Collins\nAfter you graduate.\n00:02:41 John\nOK, I can say that after graduating from film production, I would like to be a social developer in film.\n00:02:56 Collins\nOK.\n00:02:57 Collins\nAlright, now, do you have any short term goals that you're working on to move toward your desired career?\n00:03:11 John\nI think only...\nJohn\nI think it's only by majoring in my main course that's maybe...\n00:03:20 Collins\nOK.\n00:03:22 Collins\nNow I'd like to understand the reasons behind your career choices, like the motivations and the influences.\n00:03:30 Collins\nWhat really inspired you to choose your current field of study or career path?\n00:03:37 John\nOK, according to me...\n00:03:40 John\nWhat made me choose dealing with my career is that I used to see the advertisements from the film production in online YouTube, like TikToks. So it made me passionate about the production.\n00:03:54 John\nThe production.\n00:03:57 Collins\nOK.\n00:03:59 Collins\nAnd are there people in your family who have worked in the same field or friends or mentors?\n00:04:08 Collins\nWho have worked in the same field of film production.\n00:04:13 John\nNone.\n00:04:15 Collins\nOK.\n00:04:18 Collins\nI'm wondering if you encountered any role models or stories that have shaped your aspirations in the space of film production.\n00:04:32 John\nThere's none.\n00:04:34 John\nBut I think portraits made me do that, but by sitting regularly on online programmes.\n00:04:45 Collins\nOK.\n00:04:49 Collins\nAlmost to our last question.\n00:04:52 Collins\nJohn, will you share the sources of information that helped you to make decisions around your career choice, like guidance from school counsellors?\n00:05:03 Collins\nYour family members, the Internet, or just any other source.\n00:05:10 John\nThat's like nationwide.\n00:05:14 John\nI can only say that I do see some advertisements on YouTube.\n00:05:22 John\nI think.\n00:05:25 John\nTikTok platform.\n00:05:27 John\nBut there's no way in a battle mode they like.\n00:05:30 John\nLet's not lecture us about any family members.\n00:05:35 Collins\nOK.\n00:05:39 Collins\nThat's so interesting to hear.\n00:05:40 Collins\nNow on to our last question, John.\n00:05:44 Collins\nWhile speaking on film production as a career choice, I know you must have maybe experienced some uncertainties or challenges.\n00:05:56 Collins\nWhile making that decision so...\n00:06:00 Collins\nDid you really experience these challenges?\n00:06:05 John\nNo, no, I did not experience any.\n00:06:10 Collins\nOK, John, that is the end of our interview and thank you for responding.\n00:06:17 Collins\nI really appreciate the time you've taken to be here and yeah.\n"

Can you share what program or field of study you're currently pursuing in university?\n00:00:49 David\nYeah. So thank you for this moment.\nSo my name is David Nelson.\nI'm a London student who is currently enrolled in Africa internationally for Software Engineering.\n00:01:03 David\nSo I joined this program because it was with my ambition since I was young.\nI had this great ambition to be a software engineer and solve African problems.\n00:01:15 Collins\nThank you so much.\n00:01:15 David\nYeah. So...\n00:01:18 Collins\nContinue.\n00:01:22 David\nSo I first joined software engineering because it was the program I wanted to develop, but the problem was that after a month, when I joined the university, the problem I wanted to launch was developed by Samsung.\n00:01:45 David\nIt was used as a feature in Samsung S24 and I was struggling to think, \"Am I going to continue through this program?\"\nBut after that, I found out there are still many problems that I have to solve that require my attention as an African.\n00:02:07 David\nSo I found another goal, a vision, and a new goal that I have to pursue, which I’m currently pursuing. Thank you.\n00:02:18 Collins\nOh.\n00:02:19 Collins\nThank you so much for sharing that.\n00:02:22 Collins\nDavid, could you tell me about the institutions that you've attended before joining university and how they've influenced your current educational path in software engineering or in tech?\n00:02:37 David\nYeah. Thank you.\nSo, as you know, secondary school has two levels.\nIt has the low level, the best one, so in the low level, I was thinking about joining the tourism sector, as my father was currently employed in that field. But...\n00:02:58 David\nBecause of many circumstances, I found myself pursuing the science STEAM combination.\n00:03:06 David\nSo it consisted of mathematics, computer science, and economics.\n00:03:10 David\nAfter that, I found my goal and my ambition in software engineering because I was studying computer science, and I found that I had a potential to be good in it.\n00:03:22 David\nThat's why I decided I had to do something with my abilities and contribute to the community.\n00:03:34 Collins\nOK.\n00:03:35 Collins\nThank you so much. So now let's talk about your long-term career goals.\n00:03:39 Collins\nWhat are your long-term career goals or the kind of work that you envision yourself doing after you graduate?\n00:03:47 David\nYeah, thank you.\nSo my current career goals align with the development of agriculture in Rwanda.\nI want to solve the problem of people who are currently working on projects but can't connect with investors.\n00:04:04 David\nThey've found that the projects they've been doing are recognized and developed, but the problem is they can't find a platform to showcase their work.\n00:04:12 David\nThis causes underdevelopment of some projects that could solve African problems, and this is what we need in the future.\n00:04:34 Collins\nOh, OK.\nAnd are there short-term goals or steps that you're working on to move you towards that?\n00:04:44 David\nYeah, thank you.\nSo my current short-term goal is recruiting and putting together the team that will help me develop this product and bring it to the market so that we can help our fellow young Africans, not only in Rwanda but all across Africa.\n00:05:02 David\nSo that we can help Africans solve their own problems.\n00:05:10 Collins\nThank you so much for that.\n00:05:12 Collins\nDavid,\nI'm wondering if this goal has changed over time, or if you've always been focused on this same path?\n00:05:22 David\nYeah. So as I said, when I joined on my first day, I joined the African University.\nMy goal was to develop...\nIt was to develop a device that can help people emulate the language barrier. As people say, \"You want to listen in English, so you just use something like an ear plug,\" and then...\n00:05:48 David\n...you hear everything people are saying, and it gets translated into English.\nThen later, because of the Samsung S24, it included that live translation, so I found myself struggling to find another way to continue in software engineering.\n00:06:11 David\nBut later, after going through many things and further education, I found myself being interested in agriculture. Then I saw people in the class showcasing their agricultural projects.\n\n00:06:29 David\nAnd that was wonderful.\nBut then I wondered, \"Why can't I make this a real-world project and solve the problem they want to solve?\"\n\n00:06:46 David\nSo that's where I found myself focusing on this new goal.\n00:06:49 David\nTo build my career.\n00:06:51 Collins\nOK, I see.\nAnd that’s all good to hear, David. Now...\n00:06:59 Collins\nJust a minute. So I’m wondering, what really inspired you to choose software engineering?\n00:07:08 David\nWhat inspired me to choose software engineering was my current self-assessment.\nI realized that I had an interest in understanding software engineering terms, especially since I passed computer science in high school.\n00:07:31 Collins\nMm.\n00:07:32 David\nSo it made me feel interested in software engineering, but it doesn’t mean there weren’t other fields related to computer science that I could pursue. But I found myself being most interested in software engineering.\n00:07:47 Collins\nWow. Wow. Wow.\n00:07:49 Collins\nAnd what were the sources of information that helped you make decisions about software engineering?\nWas it guidance from school counselors, the internet, or other sources?\n00:08:02 David\nWhat made me choose this path...\nIt wasn’t counselors or my parents.\nIt’s because before I graduated high school, I was involved in an IT company.\n00:08:26 David\nThis was an IT company that helped people in the business world.\nIt was an organization focused on supporting those who couldn’t sustain themselves, working with NGOs.\n00:08:39 David\nWe often dealt with software-related issues, like using applications.\nAnd after working on those applications and web applications, I found myself interested in how they were developed.\n00:09:11 David\nThat’s how I ended up choosing software engineering.\n00:09:15 Collins\nAll right.\nThank you so much.\nWe’ve just come to the end of the short survey, and I really appreciate you taking the time to be with me here today.\n\n"

How are you?\n@0:16 - Collins Junior (cjotieno04@gmail.com)\nCan you hear me clearly? I can hear you. Thank you.\n@0:20 - Deborah Isimbi\nOkay.\n@0:21 - Collins Junior (cjotieno04@gmail.com)\nThank you so much for being punctual by the way. Okay, you're so punctual. Thank you.\n@0:26 - Deborah Isimbi\nThank you. Okay.\n@0:30 - Collins Junior (cjotieno04@gmail.com)\nYou know, I now feel very guilty the other times when we used to have meetings for the \ninternship.\n@0:41 - Deborah Isimbi\nOh, you weren't always me.\n@0:46 - Collins Junior (cjotieno04@gmail.com)\nSorry.\n@0:48 - Deborah Isimbi\nI'm saying you weren't always me.\n@0:52 - Collins Junior (cjotieno04@gmail.com)\nYeah, only some days when I was being engaged in other things. I found myself quite. very \nbusy to attend the meeting but I saw the guy really gave me a good review for the \ninternship.\n@1:10 - Deborah Isimbi\nOh that's nice, that's nice. Oh you were in your skills and working?\n@1:16 - Collins Junior (cjotieno04@gmail.com)\nYeah I was in my speech, it a martial form period.\n@1:21 - Deborah Isimbi\nOkay that's nice.\n@1:25 - Collins Junior (cjotieno04@gmail.com)\nPlease give me a need to open the, just a minute, please.\n@1:31 - Deborah Isimbi\nOkay.\n@1:54 - Collins Junior (cjotieno04@gmail.com)\nSo I'll just go ahead and start the recording here, so I'll just go\n@2:03 - Deborah Isimbi\nOkay.\n@2:07 - Collins Junior (cjotieno04@gmail.com)\nSo thank you so much, Deborah, for joining me today. I really appreciate the time you've \ntaken to be here.\nAnd before we begin, I just want to let you know that these are very short way to \nunderstand career aspirations and the motivations of African students.\nSo your responses will be kept confidential and will be used only for research purposes. \nAnd this session will take about 10 minutes and I'll be asking you some questions about \nyour studies, your career goals, and motivations behind your choices.\nJust feel free once as openly as you're comfortable. So yeah, let's start with a little \nintroduction about yourself, Deborah.\nCan you show what program will be your currently from Swinnye College for the capacity.\n@3:05 - Deborah Isimbi\nOkay, thank you, Collins, for having me in this survey. My name is Debra Inby. I'm a final \nyear student at the African Leadership University doing entrepreneurship and I would say \ndo I talk about my mission now or it will come in the question.\n@3:26 - Collins Junior (cjotieno04@gmail.com)\nCan I give like a overview of my mission or that will come in the question. I mean, it's just \nfine.\nIt's not a very, a very important for the professor so many such. Thank you for that Debra. \nSo could you tell me about the schools or institutions that you've attended before?\nHow they've influenced your current educational part? Can you repeat that? Could you tell \nme about the schools or institutions that you've attended before?\nYou just mentioned that you are enrolled at the African Leadership University. I'm \nwondering if you could tell me about the schools or institutions that you've attended before \njoining ALU and how they've influenced your current educational fund.\n@4:23 - Deborah Isimbi\nOkay, so before joining the African Leadership University, I was at Mount Kenya University \nin Rwanda. I did only one semester and I would say in terms of influencing my USAID \neducational goals or career goals.\nSorry, my internet was breaking off a bit.\n@4:46 - Collins Junior (cjotieno04@gmail.com)\nOkay, just your current educational fund.\n@4:50 - Deborah Isimbi\nOkay, okay, so I would say I only did one semester out to Mount Kenya. because it didn't \nreally align with what I was looking for in terms of education, which is more of studentcentered that we have here at ALU.\nSo yeah, I would say my education is mainly driven by wanting autonomy and thinking \nabout my, generally, what I want to do in the world, response I'm so happy to hear about \nthe response that you've given.\n@5:37 - Collins Junior (cjotieno04@gmail.com)\nSo let's talk about your future, I mean, basically in your, let's talk about your career \naspirations. What are your long-term career goals or the kind of work that you envision in \nyourself doing after you graduate from ALU?\n@6:00 - Deborah Isimbi\nYes, thank you. my career aspirations are to work in the field of women's empowerment. \nI'm thinking of empowering women either through education, agriculture, or in terms of \neconomic empowerment, any other thing, anything that helps that directly works with \nwomen, such as Plan International or never again on, that's why I can gain first time insight \ninto how I can help women better, either through my own initiatives or other organizations \nthat I will work with.\n@6:49 - Collins Junior (cjotieno04@gmail.com)\nWow, that's so good to hear and I really wish you really fast. So do you have any short term \ngoals or steps that you're working on to help you?\nwhat's that?\n@7:04 - Deborah Isimbi\nYes, I do. So, um, recently, I was doing an internship at St. Green, Africa. So, it didn't really \nalign with my outside career aspirations.\nIt doesn't directly align with it. However, I wanted to understand the difference because \nthere are many problems that intersect.\nIt's not a woman's problem. It's not like an independent thing.\n@7:34 - Collins Junior (cjotieno04@gmail.com)\nIt's influenced by many sectors.\n@7:37 - Deborah Isimbi\nlooking, let's say, looking at education or in terms of the economy, wouldn't fully help me \nunderstand how I would help women.\nSo, during my internship at St. Green Africa, which I did recently, it helped me look at it in \nanother lens of environmental sustainability, how environmental sustainability can also \nhelp empower women.\nwho are now, who make up the highest percentage of agricultural labor, would say, and \nanother goal or step I have taken towards my career aspiration is to attend different \nconferences, women empowerment that happen in Rwanda, which helps me learn from \nexperts on how to better identify problems that women face and how to solve them.\n@8:35 - Collins Junior (cjotieno04@gmail.com)\nI'm so happy to hear how passionate you express yourself about women empowerment \nand so I'm wondering if these your goals have changed over time or these are the same \ngoals that you've always been focused on?\n@8:55 - Deborah Isimbi\nThat's a very interesting question. in my first year of English, university team. I was mainly \nfocused on women's education.\nI didn't really look at it in any other aspect. I was like, this is what I'm going to work on and \nthis is what is going to help empower women in my community.\nHowever, as I progressed with education and the different internships I did, like I said, I \nrealized solving the issues that women have.\nYou can't just focus on one thing. And that is why I like to learn more things, to volunteer in \ndifferent things that might not seem, that might not directly align with what I'm doing, but \nsomehow they always like intersect.\nSo I would say I've really learned to change my approach to how I want to solve problems \nby ways of doing things, because\nI would say some multifaceted problems, not influenced by only one factor. I hope that \nanswers your question.\n@10:08 - Collins Junior (cjotieno04@gmail.com)\nReally concretely platforms, thank you so much, it's so interesting to understand that. So \nlet's talk, not really love to understand the reasons behind your career choices, maybe \neven the multigressions and the influencers.\nSo what really inspired you to choose your current field of study? Was it really a passion or \nwas it a specific experience or just any other part?\n@10:42 - Deborah Isimbi\nThank you for that question. So okay, I would say my main inspiration was my mom. When \ngrowing up, my mom was also doing work with women's empowerment, but at that time,\nwould always ask her why you doing this? you know, is one of the countries that, you know, \nequality is at the top, you know, women are educated and everything and everything.\nBecause I was living with my brothers, I was going to school with my brothers. So to me, me \nand my brothers were equal.\nBut I would say as I grew up and went into secondary school and, you know, outside like \nthe comfort of my home, I got to like see first-hand the different problems women face.\nIt's not just an issue of women and boys are accessing education, yes. That is all about \nequality, however, you know, I got to understand a more complex, a more complex issue, \nwhich is equity.\nWomen and boys are accessing education, yes. But is this education, so they're working \nfor women or women getting the most\n@12:00 - Collins Junior (cjotieno04@gmail.com)\noutcomes the same as as the men you know so I would say my main inspiration was from \nmy mom and also getting to see firsthand especially in rural areas under how girls struggle \nwith accessing education or jobs yeah thank you that's interesting and I'll have you \nmention in one and actually my question that was to follow is actually if you if you have \nmany people in your life who might have worked in a similar field and if they really had an \ninfluence in your decision so that's so great to hear and I think that answers my question \nbut also for you now I'm going to ask if you encounter any role models or stories of stories \nthat really shaped your aspirations in this space\n@13:00 - Deborah Isimbi\nYes, definitely, definitely. I can't remember most of them, but I'm just going to give you a \nsimple example of the girls I was with in secondary school.\nSome of them came from, I would say, very disadvantaged families where their parents \neven had rigid mindsets. Boys should be the ones who are educated and, you know, \neverything.\nSo it was really a struggle for them, but they pushed through, they, you know, they were \nable to secure scholarships on their own.\nSometimes when you're from a family that doesn't value your education, it's very easy for \nyou to also think, well, why should I care about my education and my family because it's \nimportant.\nBut the courage of this must be like, you know what, I don't care what my family has to say \nabout this, I know what I want to achieve in my life and I'm going to do it whether they like it \nor not.\nthink that That's very inspirational because it's very easy to give up and just, you know, fall \nto fall victim to most of the biotinorms.\nSo I would say the stories of encouragement from mainly from girls I went to secondary \nschool with.\n@14:21 - Collins Junior (cjotieno04@gmail.com)\nWell, that's interesting to hear. Thank you so much for sharing that much. I'm almost \nanalyzing. So I'm just wondering about the sources of information that you used to help you \nmake decisions around your choice.\nFor example, we might have to live on guidance from maybe school counselors, family or \neven the Internet. I mean, any other sources.\nI'd be happy to hear. uh your response about that?\n@15:04 - Deborah Isimbi\nYes, so the main sources I use are there are a lot of local non-governmental organizations \nthat are working towards women empowerment here such as plan international, there's \nUN women, there's never again, Rhonda.\nSo these and you'll have a lot of case studies and research on different communities in \nRhonda, these urban or rural and you know most of the times I just read through their \nresearch and case studies other than that I would say from the article from the United \nNations there's also primary information let's say you're visiting a local community here \nyou know you get to interact with the girls and understand what kind of problems we face \neither in their education or\nterms of employment. So it's mainly from secondary research on those NGOs and primary \nseeing it myself.\n@16:08 - Collins Junior (cjotieno04@gmail.com)\nThank you. Thank you so much. I'd like to understand if you first any challenges or \nopportunities when you are making these decisions or settling to the women \nempowerment and if yes, how did you come to work on that?\n@16:33 - Deborah Isimbi\nI'm sorry, could you repeat the question?\n@16:36 - Collins Junior (cjotieno04@gmail.com)\nI'm wondering if you first any challenges or uncertainties when making decisions on your \nchoice, yeah?\n@16:44 - Deborah Isimbi\nOkay, okay, that's a great question. So yes, there are a lot of challenges. For example, like I \nmentioned, times when we talk about equality, women equality here in Rwanda,\nPeople are like, well, you know, there's a lot of women in parliament. There's a lot of \nwomen in education What else do you have to do?\nSo I would say people are still When you want to like engage with a different stakeholders \nSome are still very low those minded to the fact that yes, there are equal opportunities in \nNanda But there's still an issue of equity where you know women might have access to the \nsame opportunities But they're not getting the same outcomes as men and they're still \nfacing some challenges some challenges and those In those aspects.\nSo I would say the first barrier is that understanding that There they're still a long way to go \nto ensure that women are equally empowered.\nI would say another challenge is Getting to Get it getting enough enough research I \nmentioned that there are a lot of like NGOs doing research and they have key\nbut easy as but then sometimes the issue you're looking for like I say there's an issue of \neducation employment and there's also and reproductive health rights of women.\nSo getting all that information in one place can be very hard. So sometimes you look for a \npatient either not from a credible source or it's just like not complete.\nSo it's very hard to access secondary information unless you go there yourself and make \nthe research. So yeah.\n@18:39 - Collins Junior (cjotieno04@gmail.com)\nThank you so much before for sharing your thoughts and giving me that much information \nunlike I really expected. So that is really the end of the survey or rather the short interview \nand\nI'd really say that you helped me a lot to get and make a lot of music for the purposes of the \nfact that I'm trying to do.\nThank you so much, Laura, maybe you could say something that we have. Thank you so \nmuch. I appreciate that.\nyou for having me. You have a nice time, you will stay in touch. You too."

        "content": "Audio file\n00:00:03 Collins\nYeah. So hi, Denis. Thank you for joining me today.\n00:00:07 Collins\nI really appreciate the time you've taken.\n00:00:11 Collins\nTo perform this today, and before I begin, I just want to let you know that these are short surveys aimed at understanding the career aspirations and motivations of African students.\n00:00:25 Collins\nYour responses will be kept confidential and are going to be used only for the study purposes.\n00:00:33 Collins\nThe session should take about 10 minutes.\n00:00:37 Collins\nAnd through the organization, I’ll be asking you questions about your studies, your career goals, and the motivations behind your choices.\n00:00:47 Collins\nSo just feel free to answer as openly as you're comfortable with.\n00:00:53 Collins\nDoes that make sense, Denis?\n00:00:59 Denis\nYes.\n00:01:00 Collins\nSo let's start with a brief introduction about yourself. You may want to talk about your educational background.\n00:01:08 Collins\nCan you share what program or field of study you're currently pursuing in college?\n00:01:16 Denis\nOK. About my introduction, I'm really switching.\n00:01:23 Denis\nCurrently.\n00:01:26 Denis\nI’m in Eldoret, Moi University, School of Law.\n00:01:32 Denis\nUndergraduate degree.\n00:01:35 Denis\nAs for my brief education background...\n00:01:38 Denis\nOh, I did my primary school education in a village school back in Nyamira County.\n00:01:45 Denis\nAfter completing KCPE, I joined Nyamira Boys’ High School for my secondary education.\n00:01:52 Collins\nThank you.\n00:01:53 Denis\nI think that’s enough for now.\n00:01:55 Collins\nYeah, that’s very comprehensive, Denis.\n00:01:58 Collins\nThank you for that. And in fact, you've gone ahead with such comprehensive responses that you’ve actually answered the question that was yet to follow, which was...\n00:02:10 Collins\nThe schools or institutions that you've attended before college.\n00:02:14 Denis\nYeah.\n00:02:16 Collins\nThe other part of the question would have been how these institutions have actually influenced your current educational path. Now that you're in Moi University...\n00:02:26 Collins\nIs there a way the previous institutions that you’ve attended have influenced your current educational path?\n00:02:38 Denis\nYes, actually, it’s obvious.\n00:02:40 Denis\nThe high school that I went to actually influenced my career path.\n00:02:48 Denis\nBecause, as you know, in school...\n00:02:49 Denis\nYou have to work hard in order to get those jobs or careers that are, let’s say, considered more prestigious or valued compared to others.\n00:03:04 Denis\nYeah.\n00:03:07 Collins\nOK.\n00:03:08 Denis\nAnd so, that’s what motivated me, yeah.\n00:03:12 Collins\nInteresting. Interesting, Denis. Thank you for sharing.\n00:03:17 Collins\nLet’s talk about your future. I’m interested in knowing your career aspirations.\n00:03:22 Collins\nWhat are your long-term career goals or the kind of work that you envision yourself doing after you graduate from Moi University?\n00:03:34 Denis\nOK, obviously, after graduating from Moi University...\n00:03:40 Denis\nFor law students, in order to practice law in Kenya, you have to join the Kenya School of Law, where you have to obtain that diploma.\n00:03:51 Denis\nWhich is essential for focusing on law.\n00:03:55 Denis\nSo, for my career path, I am aiming to go even higher—not just to be called an advocate, but to earn additional titles.\n00:04:05 Denis\nLike...\n00:04:10 Denis\nGod willing, after completing that course at the Kenya School of Law,\n00:04:17 Denis\nI would want to go for a Master’s if possible, and then pursue a PhD, because in Kenya, it is very competitive.\n00:04:33 Collins\nInteresting. Interesting.\n00:04:36 Collins\nI really wish you well in your current and future endeavors.\n00:04:40 Collins\nDo you have any short-term goals or steps that you’re working on to move you toward that desired career?\n00:04:49 Denis\nSorry?\n00:04:53 Collins\nIf you have any short-term goals or steps that you’re working on to move you toward your desired career.\n\n00:04:55 Collins\nIf you have any short-term goals or steps that you're working on to move you toward your desired career.\n00:05:05 Denis\nSome goals.\n00:05:06 Collins\nYes, yes.\n00:05:10 Denis\nOK, with this one.\n00:05:19 Denis\nOK.\n00:05:22 Denis\nSo short-term goals.\n00:05:25 Denis\nLike, you know, as I'm studying law, there are various things that I have to do.\n00:05:28 Denis\nFor example, the one that is called CPM. Of course, assistant or in Kenya's judicial system, they are trying to encourage what is called ADR and this ADR...\n00:05:33 Denis\nLet me know.\n00:05:41 Denis\n...is where disputes or cases are not in the court. So...\n00:05:49 Denis\nWithin a short goal, I want to be...\n00:05:53 Denis\n...CPM.\n00:05:53 Denis\nThat is, a certified professional mediator.\n00:05:59 Denis\nWhich the courts cannot fail to practice or to help in solving such disputes outside the court.\n00:06:08 Collins\nOK.\n00:06:11 Collins\nWell, that's interesting, and...\n00:06:11 Collins\nYeah.\n00:06:14 Collins\nHave your goals changed over time?\n00:06:16 Collins\nOr have you always been focused on these set goals?\n00:06:25 Denis\nI'm sorry, I didn't get you well.\n00:06:27 Collins\nYeah, I'm wondering if these goals will change over time or if you've always been focused on this career path.\n00:06:40 Denis\nOK. The question is, is it before...?\n00:06:44 Denis\n...or now, like before I joined university...?\n00:06:47 Denis\n...or as I am continuing with this career? Because in Form 1...\n00:06:54 Collins\nWe may talk about before you picked on...\n00:06:57 Collins\n...you settled on law as a profession or career.\n00:07:04 Denis\nThanks.\n00:07:04 Denis\nObviously, at first, I didn't want to do this because when I was learning in Form 1...\n00:07:12 Denis\n...of course, law was one of the careers that I chose, but I didn't major in it.\n00:07:19 Collins\nOK.\n00:07:19 Denis\nBut when things went W...\n00:07:22 Denis\n...repl.\n00:07:23 Collins\nNo, I can hear him.\n00:07:25 Denis\nSo...\n00:07:28 Denis\n...should I continue?\n00:07:29 Collins\nPlease, continue.\n00:07:32 Denis\nOK, when things went worse—what do they say? South.\n00:07:37 Denis\nObviously.\n00:07:41 Denis\nI considered medicine and surgery, but unfortunately, I couldn't make it.\n00:07:48 Denis\nBy Form 2, I got...\n00:07:50 Denis\n...and by Form 3, I just settled for law.\n00:07:53 Denis\nAnd from then, I've never changed my mind.\n00:07:56 Denis\nWell.\n00:07:56 Collins\nWow, that's so intriguing.\n00:07:57 Collins\nInteresting, Denis. I'd like to now understand the reasons why you decided to pick law, because now you mentioned in Form 1 you had something else, in Form 2 you had another thing, and by Form 3, you also had another.\n00:08:13 Collins\nNow I'm interested in knowing the motivations and influences...\n00:08:20 Collins\n...that led you to pursue law as a career.\n00:08:23 Collins\nSo what really inspired you to choose?\n00:08:27 Collins\nIncluding food and...?\n00:08:29 Collins\nWas it really a passion or maybe an experience or just sort of...?\n00:08:40 Denis\nOK.\n00:08:41 Denis\nYou know, law...\n00:08:42 Denis\n...is something that is very vast.\n00:08:45 Denis\nYou can decide to practice law, and obviously, law...\n00:08:51 Denis\n...has various specializations.\n00:08:53 Denis\nThere are criminal lawyers, corporate lawyers, and such like things.\n00:08:59 Denis\nAnd also, you can just...\n00:09:03 Denis\n...become a lecturer, or also, you can just...\n00:09:08 Denis\n...decide to...\n00:09:12 Denis\nYeah, you can just become a lecturer, of course.\n00:09:15 Denis\nAnd so, you know, you are exposed, and that’s why in Kenya, most of the politicians, most of them who have succeeded, did law. And when you are doing law, you are exposed to such people who are in a position...\n00:09:31 Denis\n...of attaining such goals as a law student. Of course, when you come from...\n00:09:40 Denis\n...the background that you come from doesn’t matter as such, so long as you have your mind set to meet such goals.\n00:09:51 Denis\nAnd also, what would validate me is that, as long as you know, lawyers are...\n00:09:59 Denis\n...a poor lawyer shouldn’t...\n00:10:00 Collins\nWhy? Why? Why?\n00:10:05 Denis\nYou know, lawyers are never poor. For example, you know, just if you have a case and you appear in court, of course the fee for justice is at least...\n00:10:27 Denis\n...at least 5000, of course, just appearing and leaving the rest.\n00:10:32 Denis\nYou can just decide and just prepare a piece of paper, one page, or you can print it for 100.\n00:10:36 Denis\nAnd, of course, when you are in such a career...\n00:10:45 Denis\n...there are various opportunities that you have, and when you explore them, it is very hard for you to become poor.\n00:10:51 Denis\nChanging my background or my home background is one of the things that motivated me to take this career path.\n00:10:59 Collins\nWell, that’s so interesting.\n00:11:01 Collins\nI really wish you all the best in your aspirations.\n00:11:07 Collins\nWhen you were doing this, I’m wondering if there are people in your life, such as your family, friends, or even mentors, who have worked in a similar field.\n00:11:21 Denis\nActually, my close...\n00:11:23 Denis\n...let’s say nuclear family.\n00:11:27 Denis\nTo be honest, I think there’s no one who has taken such a career path. In fact, the highest level anyone has gone is a primary school teacher. So, of course...\n00:11:41 Denis\n...my siblings or parents are not in such career paths. I think that didn’t have any influence on my...\n00:11:53 Collins\nOK.\n00:11:56 Denis\nYeah.\n00:11:57 Collins\nAlright. And have you ever experienced or encountered any role models or maybe stories that have just shaped your aspirations in this space?\n00:12:09\nThank you.\n00:12:13 Denis\nYes, of course. They have to be stories...\n00:12:17 Denis\n...that motivate you.\n00:12:20 Denis\nYou know the famous writer? Of course, he didn’t take the path of law, but actually, no, the famous rule—the best neurosurgeon by then—that is Ben Carson.\n00:12:36 Denis\nActually, he was from a very poor background, and before then he was...\n00:12:42 Denis\n...a student or a child who was very low or was a slacker.\n00:12:48 Denis\nHe was very poor in matters of studies, but due to the motivation of the parents who were very poor, I think this man...\n00:12:57 Denis\n...actually ended up being one of the best neurosurgeons that ever existed in the globe.\n00:13:06 Denis\nSo, of course, in Kenya, there are various people...\n00:13:10 Denis\n...like you can be proud of, though their background, I don’t know as such, but...\n00:13:17 Denis\n...actually, in their practice, they have risen to be very powerful lawyers.\n00:13:22 Denis\nVery famous people.\n00:13:24 Denis\nPeople like James Sorengo and...\n00:13:28 Denis\n...yeah, and Maraga, who once told us about his story and his struggles, and such people...\n00:13:37 Denis\nUh, I think...\n00:13:37 Denis\n...uh, they have this far actually motivated me to continue aspiring even for more.\n00:13:48 Collins\nSounds so interesting.\n00:13:51 Collins\nSounds so interesting. The game is on.\n00:13:55 Collins\nI’m just wondering if you had any sources of information that you rely on to help you make decisions around your career choices or with something you want to talk about.\n00:14:08 Collins\nYou see?\n00:14:08 Collins\nThe guidance from your school counselors or the Internet, or even the sources that motivated you to get into the career that you chose?\n00:14:22 Denis\nOK, this career path I chose...\n00:14:29 Denis\nActually, I can’t say that there was any source that motivated me to take this career.\n00:14:38 Denis\nBut I can say it was just something...\n00:14:41 Denis\n...internal that made me do so.\n00:14:46 Denis\nAnd you can do this, meaning that you can remember in high school...\n00:14:50 Denis\n...of course, we were doing Humanities...\n00:14:54 Denis\n...and what happened to be one of the subjects that I used to perform better? And that’s also in languages. So we do this...\n00:15:01 Denis\nI think they motivated me because these are the requirements that if you have, actually, you can do well in such a career path.\n00:15:08 Denis\nSo that’s why I chose this career path. But having any information...\n00:15:12 Denis\n...from other people, of course, I can say nay.\n00:15:15 Collins\nOK.\n00:15:18 Denis\nYeah.\n00:15:18 Collins\nThank you for that response, and onto my last question, which is...\n00:15:25 Collins\n...if you had challenges or opportunities in making your decision, because of course, you realize that maybe when you perform well after high school, you may have...\n00:15:37 Collins\n...a couple of options that you may want to take on. Let’s say you’re thinking about getting into...\n00:15:43 Collins\n...maybe, maybe, say you were thinking about becoming a...\n00:15:47 Collins\n...thinking about becoming a lawyer, rather than a teacher, you know, so...\n00:15:53 Collins\nIf you experienced any challenge or entertained thoughts when coming up with this decision?\n00:16:02 Denis\nOK, you know...\n00:16:06 Denis\n...as a student who is studying in a third-world country or a country like Kenya, there have to be various challenges that you encounter.\n00:16:16 Denis\nIn your academic journey, and with me...\n00:16:20 Denis\n...I can say there have been financial challenges with this, but you know, comparing law to other courses, like medicine, also...\n00:16:32 Denis\n...I can say law is a bit cheaper because law...\n00:16:37 Denis\n...as of now...\n00:16:39 Denis\n...the total school fee that we are paying is around 183,600, as compared to medical-related courses. Of course, you are paying which...\n00:16:50 Denis\n...I wish we share costs a lot to do, because for example, in my university, like, you can take, for example, medicine, which costs over 600K, so...\n00:16:56 Denis\nMatters financial challenges, or as you compare law to other courses, I think law is relatively cheaper, though such challenges have...\n00:17:16 Collins\nYeah.\n00:17:17 Collins\nYeah.\n00:17:18 Collins\nYeah, that’s so interesting.\n00:17:20 Collins\nYeah. And thank you for sharing that.\n00:17:25 Collins\nSo, Denis, you’ve come to the end of the questions, and I want to thank you so much for sharing your thoughts.\n00:17:34 Collins\nYour interests and...\n00:17:37 Collins\n...the purpose for this research?\n00:17:40 Collins\nAnd I just want to thank you once again for...\n00:17:41 Denis\nGoodnight.\n\n"

And maybe how they've influenced your current educational path, which is the course that you’re currently enrolled in?\n00:01:54 Innocent\nIn...\n00:02:01 Innocent\nI can say that my high school, Kangaroo School, has the most influence on the career I took.\n00:02:08 Innocent\nAnd...\n00:02:10 Innocent\nThe influence involves around the... I can say the grade that I got that first...\n00:02:19 Innocent\nMy overall performance in high school.\n00:02:23 Innocent\nAnd it allowed me to achieve this... this kind of course.\n00:02:29 Collins\nOK.\n00:02:29 Collins\nSo it's basically your...\n00:02:30 Innocent\nAnd also... yeah, motivation from my peers telling me, \"You can do this.\"\n00:02:43 Collins\nOK, interesting. Now let's talk about your future and, in your future, basically about your career aspirations.\n00:02:55 Collins\nWhat are your long-term career goals or the kind of work that you envision yourself doing after graduation?\n00:03:04 Innocent\nUh...\n00:03:06 Innocent\nAfter... for now I can say that I'm focusing on completing my undergraduate.\n00:03:13 Innocent\nBut after...\n00:03:16 Innocent\nAfter completing my undergraduate, I just need some time to work.\n00:03:25 Innocent\nProbably like a span of five years.\n00:03:31 Innocent\nThen I can see if I'm eligible for postgraduate, I'll join, though I'm not sure which one I'll join.\n00:03:41 Collins\nOK.\n00:03:43 Collins\nSo, it's basically working just around your...\n00:03:43\nYeah.\n00:03:50 Collins\nI mean, around your field of study, because you say you're studying medicine, and in most occasions, those who study medicine are definitely going to be medical doctors, right?\n00:04:00 Collins\nSo do you mean you want to start working in a hospital environment, or do you want to create opportunities for yourself? Or...\n00:04:12 Collins\nCould you just maybe talk about that?\n00:04:15 Innocent\nOK, if I could have an opportunity to create other opportunities or to venture in other areas...\n00:04:26 Innocent\nIt would still be...\n00:04:27 Innocent\nIt would still be matters around the hospital.\n00:04:30 Innocent\nSo even if I eventually take...\n00:04:32 Collins\nIt will be...\n00:04:34 Innocent\nAdventure in tech Med.\n00:04:38 Innocent\nYeah. So...\n00:04:40 Innocent\nI'm aspiring also to be a tech...\n00:04:44 Innocent\nAnd I just want to relate it with the medical career.\n00:04:51 Collins\nInteresting. Innocent.\n00:04:54 Collins\nThat's so...\n00:04:54 Collins\nI think a combination of tech and medicine could be a really good combination and there could be much around that.\n00:05:04 Collins\nSo let me just...\n\n00:05:07 Collins\nUnderstand if you have any short-term goals or steps that you're working on to move toward your desired career, which you mentioned is being a medical doctor.\n00:05:16\nWorked.\n00:05:17\nThank you.\n00:05:24 Innocent\nThe steps I have is...\n00:05:29 Innocent\nMust leave.\n00:05:30 Innocent\nI can say that...\n00:05:31 Innocent\nUh, my own passion drives me.\n00:05:38 Innocent\nAnother thing I can say is that I have friends.\n00:05:43 Innocent\nI have people around me who motivate me.\n00:05:45 Innocent\nThey tell me, \"You can do this.\"\n00:05:46 Innocent\nThose are some of the things that keep me going, and also the facilities by the school are also good.\n00:05:52\nWe...\n00:05:53 Innocent\nAnd they also enable one to become a good one.\n00:05:56 Collins\nOK.\n00:05:58 Innocent\nYeah.\n00:05:59 Collins\nAll right.\n00:06:01 Collins\nThat’s all great. I’m glad to hear that there are some steps that led you to your desired career.\n00:06:14 Collins\nAre these goals that you've had? Now, do you want to move into MedTech, something associated with MedTech? Have your goals changed over time, or have you always been focused on the same path?\n00:06:30 Innocent\nTo be honest,\n00:06:31 Innocent\nBefore I chose my medical career,\n00:06:36 Innocent\nI had so many options.\n00:06:39 Innocent\nSo... but...\n00:06:43 Innocent\nFor... just to be convenient...\n00:06:46 Innocent\nYou guys cannot take command and another course, so I had to choose one.\n00:06:50 Collins\nYes, yes.\n00:06:51 Innocent\nSo I ever wanted to venture into tech...\n00:06:55\nMm.\n00:06:57 Innocent\nAnd maybe architecture...\n00:07:01 Innocent\nBut you know, I had to choose one, so I went for Med, but I had some other...\n00:07:07 Collins\nAs an option.\n00:07:10 Innocent\nYeah.\n00:07:11 Collins\nOK, so...\n00:07:13 Collins\nYour short-term goals still remain. I mean, you still align your focus towards these short-term goals, right?\n00:07:24 Innocent\nYeah. I’m learning to take.\n00:07:29 Collins\nOK, OK, great. Now I'd like to understand the reasons behind your career choices.\n00:07:36 Collins\nLike, let’s talk about your motivations and...\n00:07:40 Collins\nSo what really inspired you to choose your current field of study?\n00:07:44 Collins\nOr your current career path. Was it really a passion?\n00:07:47 Collins\nA specific experience or other factors led to you choosing the field of medicine?\n00:07:59 Innocent\nWhen I... when I was young...\n00:08:05 Innocent\nI had the passion...\n00:08:07 Innocent\nI started having the passion... there were some doctors who visited us.\n00:08:12 Innocent\nAnd, you know, it was very nice interacting with them.\n00:08:15 Innocent\nSo, you know, you are young and when they come, they...\n00:08:20 Innocent\nThe excitement that when you're young, you really also want to do this.\n00:08:23 Collins\nYeah.\n00:08:26 Innocent\nAnd then now later in high school, you realize that you have the potential and you can do this.\n00:08:32 Innocent\nSo that really inspired me to do this.\n00:08:36 Collins\nOK, great.\n00:08:39 Collins\nSo are there people in your life...\n00:08:42 Collins\nLet’s talk about your family, your friends, your mentors who have worked in a similar field, and if so, have they influenced your decisions?\n00:08:53 Innocent\nYes, there...\n00:08:54 Innocent\nThere are some family members, though not in the same exact house, but, you know, courses like nursing courses, like clinical medicine. There are very many people around me...\n00:09:04 Innocent\nDid that.\n00:09:05 Innocent\nSo they also influenced me, like, “Go for the bigger one.”\n00:09:09 Collins\nOK.\n00:09:11\nYeah.\n00:09:12 Collins\nOK, great.\n00:09:16 Collins\nNow, almost to the last questions, I’d love to know if you’ve encountered any role models in the fields of medicine or other stories that have shaped your aspirations in the space.\n00:09:32 Innocent\nPardon the question, please.\n00:09:34 Collins\nI’d love to know if you’ve encountered any role models or stories that have shaped your aspirations in this space that you’re currently studying.\n00:09:47\nRepl.\n00:09:48 Innocent\nOh, talking about role models?\n00:09:55 Innocent\nI... I have to say that I'm really inspired by some people, some...\n00:09:58 Innocent\nGood doctors.\n00:10:00 Collins\nOK. Could you mention?\n00:10:01 Innocent\nHow the shock?\n00:10:05 Innocent\nI will mention...\n00:10:06 Innocent\nOne of our lecturers, who really inspired me.\n00:10:11\nNone.\n00:10:13 Innocent\nOne of our lecturers, when I was a first-year, she was called Doctor, but...\n00:10:18 Collins\nOK.\n00:10:20 Innocent\nAnd she used to have personal sessions with us.\n00:10:23 Innocent\nWe were in a group under her.\n00:10:26 Innocent\nAnd she really taught us a lot and told us to work hard, never to give up.\n00:10:35 Innocent\nWhen we were just in today. So I think Linda, that really encouraged me because I still have a long way to go.\n00:10:41 Collins\nYeah, that’s so interesting to hear.\n00:10:45 Collins\nWhat other sources of information have helped you to make decisions around your career choice?\n00:10:52 Collins\nYou know, for example, have you relied on guidance and counselling from school counselors, your family?\n00:11:00 Collins\nThe internet, or any other sources?\n00:11:06 Innocent\nUh...\n00:11:09 Innocent\nI really rely on the matters around scoring.\n00:11:14 Innocent\nNot really family.\n00:11:19 Innocent\nThe information from the school or information from peers.\n00:11:26 Innocent\nFrom senior students.\n00:11:27 Innocent\nInformation from senior lecturers, consultants.\n00:11:32\nYeah.\n00:11:34 Innocent\nSo that really changes my perspective about it and...\n00:11:39 Collins\nInteresting. Interesting.\n00:11:42 Collins\nNow, under the last section, which is really on the decision-making process.\n00:11:49 Collins\nHave you faced any challenges or uncertainties when making these decisions? Because you talk about having options like medicine and architecture.\n00:12:01 Collins\nSo maybe there was that...\n00:12:04 Collins\nYou’re not sure whether this is the course that I’m supposed to really be, or if I should really go for this one.\n00:12:10 Collins\nAnd if yes, if yes, there was that uncertainty, how did you get to overcome?\n00:12:20 Innocent\nThe way I got to overcome the uncertainty...\n00:12:24 Innocent\nIs by, I think, doing some research, going to the internet and reviewing those courses, also getting information from, you know, the... like...\n00:12:35 Innocent\nTold you that I have relatives who are nurses, clinical medicine.\n00:12:39 Collins\nYes, yes.\n00:12:39 Innocent\nSo I also get info from them because they interact with the doctors.\n00:12:46 Innocent\nSo that really influenced me because I can say that...\n00:12:52 Innocent\nThe architects around me, you know, they are not much, but the nurses were overwhelming.\n00:12:57 Innocent\nIt really influenced my decision to the other side.\n00:13:01 Collins\nInteresting all.\n00:13:03 Collins\nSo thank you so much, Innocent, for your time.\n00:13:07 Collins\nActually, that is the end of my questions, and your insights are incredibly valuable.\n00:13:16 Collins\nI really appreciate the time you’ve taken.\n00:13:19 Collins\nWithin your tight schedule, I know you’re preparing for exams at the moment.\n\n\n"

You understand the care, aspirations, and motivations of African students.\n00:00:22 Javan\nYes.\n00:00:23 Collins\nSo your responses will be kept confidential and not only for the survey purposes.\n00:00:30 Javan\nNo problem.\n00:00:32 Collins\nThe session is supposed to take about approximately 10 minutes, and I'll be asking you some questions about your studies, your career goals, and motivations behind your choices.\n00:00:45 Javan\nYes.\n00:00:50 Javan\nOK.\n00:00:51 Collins\nYes, so please...\n00:00:51 Collins\nYou need to answer as openly as you're comfortable with.\n00:00:54 Collins\nAnd yeah.\n00:00:56 Javan\nThank you.\n00:00:59 Javan\nWhen I'm ready.\n00:01:01 Collins\nSo let's start with a little introduction about...\n00:01:06 Collins\nBasically your educational background.\n00:01:10 Javan\nOK. Hello once more.\n00:01:12 Javan\nI'm Javan.\n00:01:16 Javan\nI am at the University of Nairobi, currently pursuing electrical and electronics engineering.\n00:01:23 Javan\nPrior to that, I was at Kanga High School.\n00:01:27 Javan\nFrom Form 1 to Form 4, and before that, I was in Carnival Catholic Primary School, which is in Nairobi. And yeah, along the way, I've learned quite a lot.\n00:01:41 Javan\nA lot.\n00:01:42 Javan\nAnd I'm looking forward.\n00:01:45 Collins\nThank you so much.\n00:01:48 Collins\nThank you for that elaborate introduction.\n00:01:51 Collins\nAnd it has basically answered... it's been so comprehensive that it has basically answered my second question, which...\n00:02:00 Collins\nWas about the institutions rather than schools that you attended before college or university, which you mentioned Kanga High School. You also mentioned...\n00:02:10 Collins\nWhich is very good now.\n00:02:13 Collins\nThere's just the other part, or rather the portion of the question, which...\n00:02:18 Collins\nReally is to just to know how these institutions that you've attended before campus...\n00:02:24 Collins\nActually influenced your educational path.\n00:02:31 Javan\nOK, what I can say currently is... I'm an engineering student, and I think...\n00:02:41 Javan\nThat is a...\n00:02:44 Javan\nA lot of... I can credit a lot of it to Kanga High School, where I got to meet the different types of professionals.\n00:02:53 Javan\nThat is due to the Kanga Association, which exposed me to such professionals, and I could see and hear about the engineers and they could talk a little bit about their life. And yeah, I felt motivated.\n00:03:11 Javan\nIt fascinated me being an engineer.\n00:03:14 Javan\nYeah. So most of the credit I can give to Kanga High.\n00:03:18 Javan\nBut as well as Carnival, not much since I was just a kid. Maybe I can say it just enabled me to see that I was good at math.\n00:03:24 Javan\nQuestion.\n00:03:30 Collins\nNow let's talk about your future job.\n00:03:32 Collins\nI'd love to know your career aspiration.\n00:03:36 Collins\nWhat are your long-term career goals and the kind of work that you envision yourself doing after you graduate from the University of Nairobi?\n00:03:45 Javan\nI really do have a strong passion for engineering, so I hope and pray that in future I may get in touch with the real engineering staff and...\n00:03:59 Javan\nHelp to pioneer some great innovations in the world, most majorly in the technological aspect in the tech world, as we know we are in the age where technology is growing really, really fast.\n00:04:12 Javan\nI want to be part of that wave of technological advancement.\n00:04:17 Javan\nAnd...\n00:04:19 Javan\nAs well as I don't want to be just a manager, so as much as being technical in the engineering area, I'd also love to be a manager and learn how to deal with people and such...\n00:04:35 Javan\n...of stuff.\n00:04:38 Collins\nI'm wishing you all the best. That's interesting, and...\n00:04:44 Collins\nI just wish you well in your aspirations. If you have any short-term goals or steps that you're working on to move towards your desired career.\n00:05:00 Javan\nFirstly, of course, to achieve that, I need to excel in my...\n00:05:05 Javan\nSo that's the primary goal, to excel first class, second class upper.\n00:05:12 Javan\nBut excel...\n00:05:12 Javan\nWell, so that I can achieve some great scholarships and further my studies so that I can make it to that goal of mine.\n00:05:28 Collins\nRight. That sounds so good.\n00:05:31 Collins\nGetting a first class or a second class upper is something that is very, very possible.\n00:05:41 Collins\nSo I really want to know if these goals have changed over time, or if you've always been focused on this path.\n00:05:56 Javan\nIf there is a change, I can't say it's much, it's quite negligible since...\n00:06:02 Javan\nAll along, I've...\n00:06:03 Javan\nI've known what I want to do, so...\n00:06:06 Javan\nMaybe due to the exposure that I've had over the past few months or years that I've been out here...\n00:06:15 Javan\nThey might have changed a little bit.\n00:06:17 Javan\nI've refined them more, but not towards the negative or automatic... towards the positive for the betterment...\n00:06:25 Javan\nOf that process.\n\n00:06:26\nOK.\n00:06:29 Collins\nWell, that's that's that's that's interesting.\n00:06:32 Collins\nI'd like to understand the reasons behind your career choice which you mentioned is engineering. Basically specifically electrical engineering, yeah.\n00:06:45 Collins\nSo what?\n00:06:45 Javan\nYeah.\n00:06:46 Collins\nWhat really inspired you to choose these fields of study? And I'm interested to know if this was really a passion or a specific experience for just other factors.\n00:07:03 Javan\nThe lexical.\n00:07:05 Javan\nWell, I can say this.\n00:07:08 Javan\nWhile choosing, I knew I wanted to be an.\n00:07:11 Javan\nBut I didn't know specifically electrical engineering. I've come to love the field.\n00:07:17 Javan\nAs I am studying it right now, I've come to love the realm of electrical.\n00:07:23 Javan\nBut initially, I can only sustain that. I wasn't sure which one specifically, but in general engineering I have I.\n00:07:32 Javan\nI can say it was a passion since childhood, since I really loved the innovation, the technical aspect of it, and.\n00:07:42 Javan\nThe mathematics and all that.\n00:07:44 Javan\nYeah. Then those are some of the things.\n00:07:47 Javan\nI.\n00:07:48 Javan\nSee the life of some great engineers, those who made it, and I could.\n00:07:53 Javan\nI couldn't my. So that's together with.\n00:07:57 Javan\nThe fact that the.\n00:08:00 Javan\nMotivated me, driving me to choose this course.\n00:08:06\nYes.\n00:08:08 Collins\nWell, that's that's that's cool. Sounds very.\n00:08:13 Collins\nReal. I'm interested to know if there are people in your life, maybe your family, your friends, or mentors who have actually worked in this similar field and if so.\n00:08:25 Collins\nHow have they influenced your decisions?\n00:08:32 Javan\nYeah, I have a feeling that is more work.\n00:08:37 Javan\nNot in electrical engineering per se, but.\n00:08:41 Javan\nIn engineering generally.\n00:08:45 Javan\nAnd we have, we don't.\n00:08:46 Javan\nWe don't really talk that much, but during the time of choosing the career, they really motivated me.\n00:08:55 Javan\nYeah, they told me the real things about what to expect in engineering.\n00:09:01 Javan\nAlright, through Disneyland. And they told me the troubles and.\n00:09:07 Javan\nAnd what to expect in general?\n00:09:09 Javan\nReality of.\n00:09:10 Javan\nSo I can say they gave me.\n00:09:14 Javan\nQuite, quite, quite.\n00:09:15 Javan\nTalk before, before, before making the choice.\n00:09:20 Collins\nAlright.\n00:09:23 Collins\nThank you so much for sharing that.\n00:09:25 Collins\nJavan, you mentioned relatives in the build.\n00:09:30 Collins\nAnd now these people are in some way giving you advice, you know, which is very.\n00:09:38 Collins\nUnnecessary, I'd say for someone graduating directly from high school now.\n00:09:45 Collins\nThere's that role of role models. There's that role that they play in.\n00:09:51 Collins\nAnd maybe shaping your inspiration or I'd say.\n00:09:58 Collins\nYou know, there are also stories out there that may help you.\n00:10:04 Collins\nShape your aspirations in the field that you are in.\n00:10:07 Collins\nCould you?\n00:10:08 Collins\nWould you? Would you like to talk about that?\n00:10:13 Javan\n****. **** question.\n00:10:18 Collins\nJust interested in knowing if you.\n00:10:22 Collins\nMaybe encountered or interacted with role models or other stories that may have shaped your aspirations in the space of engineering?\n00:10:35 Javan\nYeah, yeah, I.\n00:10:37 Javan\nI can mention one incident to high school where one of the Conga Old Boys Association, one of them came by and.\n00:10:51 Javan\nDuring those functions, Coba and they used to.\n00:10:56 Javan\nAnd then he used to talk a lot. And yeah, share some of his life stories, but.\n00:11:05 Javan\nI just saw him and I felt like this is what I want. So.\n00:11:10 Collins\nYeah.\n00:11:12 Javan\nI feel this is the life I want, and that’s that’s to me was very.\n00:11:17 Javan\nA major driving factor? A major one.\n00:11:21 Javan\nThat’s the one I can point out.\n00:11:24 Collins\nAnd do you rely on any?\n00:11:27 Collins\nI mean, did you rely on any sources of information that maybe helped you make these decisions around a career choice for, for instance, maybe?\n00:11:37 Collins\nGuidance from your school counselors, maybe your family, the Internet, or any other sources.\n00:11:46 Javan\nYeah. Yeah, I convention too.\n00:11:48 Javan\nFirstly, the Internet really helped me.\n00:11:51 Javan\nI did a lot.\n00:11:53 Javan\nI did a lot of research over the Internet to look at the engineering and everything surrounding engineering.\n00:12:02 Javan\nThen finally, yes, my dad really helped me, exposed me to some of his coworkers who are engineers, electrical.\n00:12:11 Javan\nAnd that lady really, really taught me a lot about electrical engineering and engineering in general and yeah, how to program. Maneuver your way through the.\n00:12:23\nPop.\n00:12:24 Collins\nSounds so inspirational.\n00:12:29 Collins\nNow to our last question. Have you faced any uncertainties or challenges when making career decisions?\n00:12:42 Javan\nOh.\n00:12:43 Javan\nOh yes, that is. Yeah, yeah.\n00:12:49 Javan\nMaking the decision, I had a lot of.\n00:12:51 Javan\nQuestions because I was weighing between medicine and engineering, and it was quite a battle.\n00:12:59 Javan\nIt was quite a battle, but I can.\n00:13:02 Javan\nOn.\n00:13:02 Javan\nI chose 1 and I’m really contented with it.\n00:13:07 Collins\nSo how? How did you come to overcome these challenges?\n00:13:14\nRepl.\n00:13:15 Javan\nMajorly I’d advise someone to really, really, really talk to experts, to people in the field.\n00:13:21 Javan\nTalking, if you're, for example, in my case I was weighing between medicine and engineering, I went out and looked for people in the field and.\n00:13:30 Javan\nThey told me the realities and everything, and through that I made my decision.\n00:13:38 Collins\nOK.\n00:13:39 Javan\nYeah.\n00:13:41 Collins\nThank you so much.\n00:13:43 Collins\nThank you for sharing your thoughts.\n00:13:47 Collins\nThe insights are incredibly valuable.\n00:13:48 Collins\nYou.\n00:13:52 Collins\nAnd I really appreciate the time you've taken to give me information about your aspirations and how you maneuvered through.\n\n"

So let's start with a little introduction about yourself.\n00:00:50 Collins\nYou may want to talk about educational.\n00:00:52 Collins\nCan you share what program or field of study you're currently pursuing in college?\n00:01:00 Jonas\nI'm gonna.\n00:01:03 Jonas\nAsk a student of mechanical and production engineering at more university. Yeah, OK.\n00:01:09 Collins\nThat's great to hear, Jonas.\n00:01:11 Collins\nCould you tell me about the schools or institutions that you've attended before college and how they've influenced your current educational path?\n00:01:22 Jonas\nYeah, I I took my camera because when I see that Academy, I'm gonna. I later went to attend high school, which is actually known for maths and sciences. I think that's actually what made me become an engineer because.\n00:01:37 Jonas\nIt was a school which was actually which, after the majored in maths and sciences.\n00:01:42 Jonas\nYeah, I think kinda is what made me become an engineer today.\n00:01:43\nThanks.\n00:01:46 Collins\nOK, great.\n00:01:47\nGreat.\n00:01:48 Collins\nNow let's talk about your future.\n00:01:50 Collins\nWhat are some of the long term career goals or the kind of work you envision yourself doing after graduation?\n00:01:58\nPardon.\n00:01:59 Collins\nWhat are your long term career goals or the kind of work that you envision yourself doing after graduating from more university?\n00:02:09 Jonas\nI think I've got the meeting at noon W day. I think. I don't think this will be the end of my my education first because I want to proceed to.\n00:02:20 Jonas\nDo my higher education. My father, father, my studies, I think.\n00:02:24 Jonas\nGood.\n00:02:26 Jonas\nNeed to improve in in the field of engineering, but I don't think.\n00:02:32 Jonas\nI have the goals first the career goals because after I went to studies abroad first, yeah.\n00:02:42 Collins\nThat's that's interesting.\n00:02:44 Collins\nDo you have any now?\n00:02:48 Collins\nHave these your goals or let me rather ask, do you have any short term goals?\n00:02:53 Collins\nYou're working on to help you move to where you envision yourself after graduation.\n00:03:00 Jonas\nWe admission myself for aggregation.\n00:03:04 Jonas\nI can come.\n00:03:05 Collins\nNot like like long short term goals. That or steps that you're working on to to move you towards that place where you're envisioning yourself after graduation?\n00:03:18 Jonas\nOK, I think after after graduating I think I want to see myself working in this field of engineering in the field of mechanical engineering, I think.\n00:03:29 Jonas\nI don't get your question very well.\n00:03:31 Collins\nLike if you have any short short term goals short term goals yeah. Because you mentioned that your long term goal you want to after moving from more university you want to go and further your studies abroad in the same field.\n00:03:41 Jonas\nTell me please.\n00:03:46 Collins\nI'm wondering if you have a short term goal.\n00:03:49 Collins\nOr steps that you're working on to help you get there.\n00:03:55 Jonas\nAt the at the moment I think what what I'm working on is achieving the grades here at my university. That would make me actually managed to go and study and study there because you come to go there with.\n00:04:09 Jonas\nI think for me to go outside abroad to go to masters abroad.\n00:04:12 Jonas\nA.\n00:04:13 Jonas\nA scholarship you have to 1st have a first class honors.\n00:04:17 Jonas\nSo I think what I'm looking for now is having the basics of the knowledge to allow me that first class on us.\n00:04:24 Jonas\nYeah, that's what I'm looking on at the moment.\n00:04:26 Collins\nWow, that that's so.\n00:04:28 Collins\nAnd I'm wondering if your goals.\n00:04:30 Collins\nI've ever changed overtime or you've always been focused on these same paths of engineering.\n00:04:42 Jonas\nI think before I wanted to become a lawyer.\n00:04:46\nUh.\n00:04:49 Jonas\nAfter some time I came and realised that I was good in sciences.\n00:04:54 Jonas\nOK, and mathematics?\n00:04:56 Jonas\nYeah. And that's why I change and take this this career path of becoming an engineer.\n00:05:04\nYeah. OK.\n00:05:05 Collins\nGreat. Thank you so much for that response.\n00:05:09 Collins\nNow I'd like to understand the reasons behind your career choices.\n00:05:14 Collins\n00:05:18 Collins\nWhat really inspired you to choose engineering as a career?\n00:05:20 Collins\nWas it a passion?\n00:05:21 Collins\nA specific experience or just other factors?\n00:05:25 Jonas\nI think I have a number of factors, but let me become an engineer and what I've really talked about is because the schools it was before was good in sciences and mathematics. And then the second factor was because I saw what engineers used to do out here, and I was really passionate about it.\n00:05:37 Jonas\nI saw... I'm not familiar with this, by the way, and I used to see what in the news were doing when they became.\n00:05:45 Jonas\nAnd I fell in love with what they were doing.\n00:05:49 Jonas\nThat's uh, I never...\n00:05:54 Jonas\nOK. Yeah.\n00:06:01 Collins\nThank you so much for sharing, Jonas.\n00:06:03 Collins\nIt's great to hear that your passion for engineering grew. Now, are there people in your life such as your family, friends, or mentors who have worked in the same field?\n00:06:15 Jonas\nI think my family... There's no person that I have a family friend who is an engineer, but he's not working in the field of mechanical engineering.\n00:06:25 Collins\nOK.\n00:06:28 Collins\nDid they influence your decisions to get into the field?\n00:06:38 Jonas\nI think they just shared with me something after I decided I want to become an engineer, but at the beginning, they didn't have a big impact in making this decision.\n00:06:51 Collins\nOK, OK.\n00:06:53 Collins\nAlright, so I'm wondering if you've encountered any role models or stories that have shaped your aspirations in the same space?\n00:07:06 Jonas\nI think at the moment, I will check that guy as my role model in this field.\n00:07:14 Jonas\nBecause I think he's the only engineer in my village.\n00:07:17 Jonas\nAn engineer in my community.\n00:07:20 Jonas\nYeah, I think he is now my role model.\n00:07:25 Collins\nYeah. OK. OK.\n00:07:27 Collins\nNow, what are some of the sources of information that you're using to make decisions around this choice? We have a couple of sources that you might have used. For instance, we may talk about guidance from school counselors, family, or even the Internet, or just any other sources. Could you mention where you've gathered this information?\n00:07:53 Jonas\nI think currently...\n00:07:57 Jonas\nThe director has...\n00:08:00 Jonas\nYouTube lectures, and also the Internet. There's a lot of information on the Internet, so sometimes I use the Internet as much as I can.\n00:08:12 Collins\nOK.\n00:08:14 Collins\nThank you so much for that.\n00:08:23 Collins\nGood response now.\n00:08:26 Collins\nTo our last question, I’ve actually heard you mention that you initially were interested in pursuing law. Or you wanted to be a lawyer, and I know after high school, students usually have many options and are always in a state of uncertainty, wondering which course is best for them.\n00:08:47 Collins\nConsidering you performed well, now where should you be going and what should you be doing?\n00:08:53 Collins\nSo I'm wondering, did you experience any challenges or uncertainties when making the decision to pursue engineering?\n00:09:01 Jonas\nI don’t think I’ve experienced any challenges so far because I think I applied for both law and engineering, and I was in this field of engineering.\n00:09:12 Jonas\nAnd I think that was an advantage to me because after high school, I decided I want to become an engineer.\n00:09:27 Jonas\nSo when I was...\n00:09:32 Collins\nGreat.\n00:09:33 Collins\nThat’s all great to hear, Jonas, and thank you so much for sharing your thoughts and insights into this research.\n00:09:42 Collins\nThey are very valuable to what I’m currently doing.\n\n"

After this moment, I’m so grateful that I was...\n00:02:35 Gabriel\nEquipped for college, and, you know, joining the university was not my problem.\n00:02:41 Gabriel\nBut there was this sense of unsettlement.\n00:02:53 Gabriel\nConsisting of several things.\n00:02:56 Gabriel\nThat I still go with, like, that is how it is.\n00:03:01 Gabriel\nAnd yeah, so I would say...\n00:03:05 Collins\nThank you so much.\n00:03:07 Gabriel\nYeah, thank you.\n00:03:08 Collins\nPlease go ahead. Go ahead, please.\n00:03:12 Gabriel\nYeah, sure. So...\n00:03:15 Gabriel\nBack to high school, you know, the sense of community involvement and giving back was, you know, a positive thing to us. And that is where we lay, like giving back to our communities as a positive thing that we should consider in the future.\n00:03:32 Gabriel\nAs we also navigate in the journey of academics, not only academics, but we should also fall back to give back to our communities.\n00:03:39 Gabriel\nSo, that is the mindset as I attend the college right now.\n00:03:43 Gabriel\nI have this mindset of giving back to the community, going back to my community, and creating a positive impact that could also improve the lives of other people, yeah.\n00:03:52 Collins\nThank you so much for sharing that, Gabriel.\n00:03:56 Collins\nThank you so.\n00:03:57 Collins\nThat's very inspirational, and I really wish you well in your future aspirations.\n00:04:05 Collins\nLet's talk about your...\n00:04:14 Collins\nOh, sorry about that.\n00:04:18 Collins\nLet's talk about your future goals.\n00:04:22 Collins\nMaybe your current career aspirations?\n00:04:25 Collins\nWhat are your long-term career goals or the kind of work that you envision yourself doing after you graduate from college?\n00:04:38 Gabriel\nWell, thank you very much.\n00:04:39 Gabriel\nMy future career goals are aligned with my studies, and I plan to work at Amazon in the years to come because...\n00:04:48 Gabriel\nMy course is software engineering, and Amazon is a great company that fosters a sense of, you know, bringing ideas into reality. And my course, as a software engineering student, equips me with software skills, the knowledge, and the experience I’ve gained in the field of software.\n00:05:04 Gabriel\nYou know, I want to work at Amazon in the days to come because I want to turn the ideas I have into reality, and that is the only place that I hope to bring these ideas into.\n00:05:27 Collins\nThank you for that.\n00:05:28 Collins\nPrecise response, Gabriel.\n00:05:30 Collins\nIt's very possible for you to be there.\n00:05:32 Collins\nJust requires determination and hard work, you know, and you’re definitely going to get there.\n00:05:38 Gabriel\nReally.\n00:05:40 Collins\nSo I’m wondering if you have any short-term goals or steps that you’re working on to move towards your desired career.\n00:05:47 Collins\nYou’re talking about wanting to go and work…\n\n00:05:50 Collins\nIn Amazon, would you want to maybe mention some of the short term goals or steps that you're working on to move you there?\n00:05:59 Gabriel\nWell, thank you very.\n00:06:00 Gabriel\nMy Showtime goes. You know, one of my short time goals is, you know, it's about, you know, I have this idea of creating a space for, you know, for educating young leaders about tech technology.\n00:06:16 Gabriel\nAnd you know, I had this idea when I joined the university because I had challenges when I joined the university about, you know, diving into the world of software engineering. And so I was hoping like to create this space.\n00:06:30 Gabriel\nIs that other?\n00:06:32 Gabriel\nOther students would also go into and also learn because you know joining in to, you know, while that I've never experienced you, you experience a lot of uncertainty, right. And I was also, you know, hoping like this people.\n00:06:48 Gabriel\nWho are also joining the.\n00:06:50 Gabriel\nThe Lena the student. They are also going through a lot.\n00:06:52 Gabriel\nI will do is my short term goal.\n00:06:55 Gabriel\nI will create the space where all the student the learners could just come together and learn something that will prepare them as they join the university.\n00:07:04 Gabriel\nSo yeah, and that is the dream that I have.\n00:07:04 Collins\nOK.\n00:07:08 Collins\nWow, you're doing a lot of work, Gabriel, and definitely your future is very luminous.\n00:07:16 Collins\nAre these your goals changed over time or have you always been focused on these same path?\n00:07:25 Gabriel\nWell, you know this thing. It just came across because when I joined the university, this is where I realized that there is a problem that need to be solved because the existing US.\n00:07:38 Gabriel\nEr also solving the problem.\n00:07:40 Gabriel\nThey are not.\n00:07:40 Gabriel\nYou know, they are not into the problem exactly.\n00:07:43 Gabriel\nBecause most of these learners, let me say across the continent of Africa.\n00:07:49 Gabriel\nSo they're experiencing this challenge.\n00:07:52 Gabriel\nChallenge of software things things to do is take so and I know that also takes. You know companies that also working on that, but they're not solving the exact problem so.\n00:08:05 Gabriel\nMy idea of creating that space of bringing these young tech leaders and, you know, engaging them and learning something new that prove their future careers, you know, I thought to of doing this right because I've seen that the existing system does not solving this problem.\n00:08:11 Collins\nWork, work, work, work.\n00:08:26 Gabriel\nSo it just started when I joined the university.\n00:08:30 Collins\nOK.\n00:08:32 Collins\nThat's so great to hear.\n00:08:33 Collins\nNow I'd like to understand the reasons behind.\n00:08:37 Collins\nYou peaking on software engineering and the reason behind you wanting to really?\n00:08:45 Collins\nWent into Drake? Yeah.\n00:08:50 Gabriel\nMy motivation behind software engineering started from the age of 15.\n00:08:57 Gabriel\nSo when I was a young boy, so I was just curious to learn.\n00:09:00 Gabriel\nThat concern takes that concern. You know, tech thing and the device is the all these kind of things that concern technology.\n00:09:09 Gabriel\nSo I was just a young boy who is.\n00:09:13 Gabriel\nJust who was just curious to dive deep into the world of software engineering and also the role of technology.\n00:09:18 Gabriel\nAnd you know, I began to to work on things like radio and whatever things, right.\n00:09:26 Gabriel\nAnd then I also you know, as I grew up, so I was hoping like one day I'm going to be in the Department of Software engineering and you know contribute positively like tech now has to decide there's a tie this side of positive contribution.\n00:09:43 Gabriel\nAlso, this side of negative contribution, but I was like OK instead.\n00:09:48 Gabriel\nObserving things that concern negatively.\n00:09:50 Gabriel\nI would be able to turn this technology thing, skills and knowledge into the positive things right? And you know, try to change the narrative that is ongoing.\n00:10:01 Gabriel\nSo that was the motivation behind that. And when I joined the university, I was like, OK, that's fine.\n00:10:09 Gabriel\nSo this is the the moment that I'm going to use the skills and the knowledge that I'm going to gain to change the narrative and contribute positively to our community and then our country and the entire continent.\n00:10:21 Gabriel\nSo that was the motivation behind that and.\n00:10:23 Gabriel\nCurrently that is what I'm aiming for.\n00:10:27 Collins\nWow. Wow. Wow, that's so.\n00:10:29 Collins\nSo are there people in your life such as your family, your friends or mentors who have maybe worked in the same field and have these people really influenced your decisions?\n00:10:43 Collins\nI mean, you just talked about a couple things. You know your passion and what not so.\n00:10:49 Collins\nTo talk about maybe these people if they are and how they've influenced your decisions.\n00:10:57 Gabriel\nWell, The thing is, you know, when I when I was at the age of 15.\n00:11:03 Gabriel\nYou know my brother was working in, you know, at Equity Bank.\n00:11:07 Gabriel\nSo he was working there.\n00:11:10 Gabriel\nAnd the motivation behind.\n00:11:11 Gabriel\nThe person who motivated me or this guy was great guy called Bill Gates.\n00:11:17 Gabriel\nKnow Bill Gates.\n00:11:19 Gabriel\nSo Bill Gates?\n00:11:21 Gabriel\nYeah.\n00:11:22 Gabriel\nSo this guy.\n00:11:23 Gabriel\nSo this guy was known for his exceptional leadership skills in technology and the things that concentrate right.\n00:11:31 Gabriel\nSo people used to praise him like, you know, these guys are great guy.\n00:11:35 Gabriel\nAlso contributing positively to our is changing the narrative.\n00:11:39 Gabriel\nI was like, OK.\n00:11:41 Gabriel\nThis is the guy that one day, so I'll be like this guy.\n00:11:44 Gabriel\nSo the motivation behind that came from building and also.\n00:11:50 Gabriel\nWithin the environment, you know because the environment sometimes influence you to involve yourself into things that you should adapt to.\n00:11:57 Gabriel\nSo the dreams was within, but it was motivated by Bill Gates because of that.\n00:12:04 Gabriel\nThat was that.\n00:12:07 Collins\nThat's.\n00:12:07 Collins\nThat's so interesting to hear.\n00:12:09 Collins\nSo interesting to hear.\n00:12:10 Collins\nAnd that was going to lead me to another question that talks about any role models or or stories that you've encountered. You know that shaped your your.\n00:12:21 Collins\nBut I'm just so happy that you just mentioned that.\n00:12:26 Collins\nMaybe if you just want to shed something, I mean add more light if there is nothing to add, then that's fine.\n00:12:32 Collins\nWe can move to the next question.\n00:12:38 Gabriel\nI think the the the network is just.\n00:12:42 Collins\nOK, OK.\n00:12:43 Collins\nSo let's just keep that part, can we?\n00:12:48 Collins\nI mean, what are some of the sources of information that has helped you to make decisions around your career choice?\n00:12:55 Collins\nExample, you may want to talk about.\n00:12:58 Collins\nGuidance from your school counselors or the family, or maybe the Internet or just other sources.\n00:13:08 Gabriel\nWell, The thing is at our university, so the system of learning is different, right is online thing.\n00:13:16 Gabriel\nWe usually take things online and you know, sometimes you need to go to your mission creator.\n00:13:24 Gabriel\nAnd you try to see more of things like dive into the mission that you're working on, and then you will get advices or you will get some of the tips proceeded. Then you proceed.\n00:13:38 Gabriel\nFrom the omission queries and that is the things that we are doing right now and mostly some of the times you need to figure out things by yourself, right?\n00:13:47 Gabriel\nBecause you need to do things by yourself.\n00:13:49 Gabriel\nNeed to discover.\n00:13:50 Gabriel\nYou need to do things by your own pack so.\n00:13:53 Gabriel\nAnd based on you know, we have facilitated on campus. We also have a mission creators who can guide us into what to do.\n00:14:03 Gabriel\nAnd you know, doing that based on your mission and the desire that you would hope that this thing will work and this thing will also change the lives of other people around you. And giving back to the community is important thing that we consider the university.\n00:14:22 Gabriel\nAnd yeah, so it's based on the facilitators and the mission theaters.\n00:14:26 Gabriel\nThese are the people who are just inspiring us to dive into things that could change.\n00:14:32 Gabriel\nThing for the world that we are living in.\n00:14:35\nWow.\n00:14:36 Collins\nThat's so interesting to.\n00:14:38 Collins\nGabriel, on to our last question.\n00:14:42 Collins\nHave you faced any uncertainties when wanting?\n00:14:46 Collins\nI mean, you know, as I am a person who is graduating from high school.\n00:14:51 Collins\nAt some point you have a couple options to pick.\n00:14:55 Collins\nMaybe you wanted to go and you wanted to be a pilot when you are.\n00:15:00 Collins\nMaybe you wanted to be a doctor and now you are here on the software engineering. So I'm wondering if you had.\n00:15:07 Collins\nSome uncertainties when.\n00:15:09 Collins\nMaking these decisions of on your career.\n00:15:18 Gabriel\nI would say I think it's just a kind of a tips right, tips to the high school students who is dreaming outside there to be a pilot, a pilot doctor.\n00:15:29 Gabriel\nSo I would say you know.\n00:15:32 Gabriel\nGetting there, getting there requires, you know, a determination, hard work and also, you know.\n00:15:39 Gabriel\nCall.\n00:15:40 Gabriel\nConsistency, right? Because if you bleed in something, you must dive into that.\n00:15:46 Gabriel\nYou must also try to chase that thing that you are, you know, aiming to achieve right. And it starts with that dream, right?\n00:15:54 Gabriel\nIt started that dream. If you ever dream and then you should find ways of achieving this, this, this bringing this idea into the reality that you you deserve to have. And as a student that is struggling to.\n00:16:11 Gabriel\nBring that dream to achieve the goal that you or she is desired.\n00:16:16 Gabriel\nSo I would say.\n00:16:18 Gabriel\nYou know.\n00:16:20 Gabriel\nTry to connects right. Try to connect and it worked with the people that love you, right?\n00:16:28 Gabriel\nBecause connection is easy nowadays.\n00:16:30 Gabriel\nWe have.\n00:16:32 Gabriel\nMobile phones. We have Internet where people can connect.\n00:16:34 Gabriel\nSee, you can connect with variety of people and you can easily get mentors. You can easily get.\n00:16:43 Gabriel\nYou know the mentors that could, you know, impact into your journey.\n00:16:47 Gabriel\nAs you also leave the high school as you graduates, you will dive into the.\n00:16:51 Gabriel\nAnother space that is beyond you, the space that you have never seen, and with your dreams you carry along your dreams, right?\n00:17:00 Gabriel\nYou carry along your dreams and.\n00:17:03 Gabriel\nYou hope to grab that dream to bring into reality. So I would say just try to connect as a student with mentors, with other students who are above you, the college student, the university students and the people that are in the fields of.\n00:17:18 Gabriel\nIn the fields that you hope.\n00:17:20 Gabriel\nTo die deep, right?\n00:17:22 Gabriel\nSo yeah, so I would say that as a matter of connection, try to also try to recite by your own, because journey to greatness again, the successes you start with yourself and try to navigate around you and also try to extend far beyond.\n00:17:39 Gabriel\nYeah.\n00:17:40 Collins\nThank you so much Gabriel for sharing your thoughts and insights into this research.\n00:17:47 Collins\nI really appreciate the time you've taken to listen to the questions and response, respond to them. So, so precisely.\n\n\n"

So let's start with a little introduction about yourself, Killion. You may want to talk about your educational background.\n00:01:01 Killion\nThanks. Thank you.\n00:01:04 Killion\nMy name is Killion Jack Oliver.\n00:01:08 Killion\nCurrently second-year student at Kissimmee.\n00:01:13 Killion\nTaking a Bachelor of Science in software engineering.\n00:01:21 Killion\nI joined Kissy from Kanga High School with a good grade.\n00:01:29 Killion\nWhereas.\n00:01:33 Killion\nMy primary education, I acquired it from.\n00:01:37 Killion\nRongo primary school.\n00:01:39\nOK.\n00:01:40 Killion\nIs there anything else?\n00:01:44 Collins\nWell, thank you for highlighting the institutions that you've attended before joining Kiss University, Killion. So I'm just interested in knowing if these institutions that you've joined before, you mentioned Kanga High School. You've also mentioned Rongo primary school.\n00:02:03 Collins\nJust interested in knowing if any of these institutions have actually had an influence in your current educational path.\n00:02:16 Killion\nYeah, actually, it's both Rongo and Kanga school.\n00:02:20 Killion\nFirst of all.\n00:02:24 Killion\nRongo primary gave me a very good background which enabled me to survive through the high school life at Kanga High School. It gave me the...\n00:02:33 Killion\nLet me say, let me call it the foundation.\n00:02:45 Killion\nI should strive through high school.\n00:02:49 Killion\nOK. And secondly, Kanga school?\n00:02:51 Killion\nI learnt a lot there.\n00:02:55 Killion\nFrom friends, teachers and quite good teachers.\n00:02:58 Killion\nAnd I acquired a lot of good friends from there, which makes me think.\n00:03:07 Killion\nBoth the dear friends and teachers influenced me much, which enables me to pass my KCC exams.\n00:03:21 Collins\nWell.\n00:03:23\nYeah.\n00:03:23 Collins\nSo that's...\n00:03:25 Collins\nThat's all interesting to learn, Killion, about how the other institutions have actually influenced your current educational path and leading you to this university and now you're a sophomore as a software engineering student?\n00:03:43 Collins\nSo let's talk about your future, Killion.\n00:03:46 Collins\nI'm really interested in knowing your career aspirations.\n00:03:50 Collins\nSo you may want to talk about your long-term career goals or the kind of work you envision yourself doing after graduation.\n00:04:00 Killion\nAnd thank you so.\n00:04:01 Killion\nFirst of all.\n00:04:05 Killion\nMyself as a young boy.\n00:04:07 Killion\nI always liked to.\n00:04:09 Killion\nI always liked associating myself with technology.\n00:04:15 Killion\nBy technology, I mean much of computing.\n00:04:20 Killion\nI always felt very passionate about.\n00:04:25 Killion\nThe computing world.\n00:04:27 Killion\nWhich enabled me to make a decision when choosing my career path.\n00:04:33\nOK, OK.\n00:04:33 Killion\nAt Kanga school, I had a very good teacher.\n00:04:38\nIt...\n00:04:39 Killion\nOh.\n00:04:44 Killion\nYeah.\n00:04:45 Killion\nYeah.\n00:04:46 Collins\nSorry, Killion. I'm losing you. I think it's because of Internet.\n00:04:53 Collins\nWould you just want to maybe close your video?\n00:05:01 Collins\nHello, can you hear me?\n00:05:04 Killion\nI can hear you.\n00:05:07 Collins\nPlease go.\n00:05:08 Collins\nI just lost...\n00:05:09 Collins\nI think it's because of Internet connection issues.\n00:05:12 Killion\nYeah, I'm sorry.\n00:05:15 Killion\nSo as I was saying.\n00:05:18 Killion\nRight now at Kiss University, I feel quite confident.\n00:05:25 Killion\nThat at the end of my education at the institution,\n00:05:33 Killion\nI feel very confident that I will graduate with a very good degree if.\n00:05:40 Killion\nI don't think it can be and if not first class, that's my...\n00:05:46 Killion\nTag it and that's what I feel like I should achieve and.\n00:05:47 Collins\nWow.\n00:05:52 Killion\nAfter, yeah.\n00:05:55 Collins\nYeah, I'm just supporting what you're saying, really.\n00:05:59\n00:05:59 Killion\nSo.\n00:06:01 Killion\nAfter completing.\n00:06:04 Killion\nMy degree. That's when I think now the real life comes in, not school.\n00:06:11 Killion\nJust about some few practicals these days, but after campus.\n00:06:19 Killion\nI know it can be quite hard.\n00:06:23 Killion\nOr simple depending on the person.\n00:06:27 Killion\nWhich according to me.\n00:06:30 Killion\nFrom the knowledge I'm acquiring skills I'm acquiring from school, from friends, from the Internet.\n00:06:39 Killion\nI feel like I feel like and I know that it won't be such a very bad day.\n00:06:49 Killion\nReally difficult task to find myself a way to earn a living.\n00:06:54 Collins\nYeah, definitely.\n00:06:57 Killion\nYeah. So by that. Yeah, by that, what I'm trying to say is that.\n00:06:57 Collins\nWell, that's amazing.\n00:07:04 Killion\nMaybe, you know, in life you might graduate a degree in computing science and you end up somewhere, maybe doing something else.\n00:07:14 Killion\nWhich is not claimed yet degree.\n00:07:19\n00:07:20 Killion\nYes.\n00:07:23 Killion\nSo even myself.\n00:07:25 Killion\nTill now.\n00:07:32 Killion\nI’m not quite sure if I manage to get myself to secure myself.\n00:07:33 Killion\nNot a top-notch...\n00:07:44 Killion\nMm hmm, dealing with software. But you know, the field of computing sciences is quite...\n00:07:48 Killion\nAnd I believe I can find somewhere...\n00:07:51 Collins\nYes, yes.\n00:07:53 Collins\nOK, that's so great, Killion, and I wish you so well in your aspirations.\n00:07:54\nYeah.\n00:08:01 Collins\nDo you have any short-term goals or steps you're working on to move toward your desired career?\n00:08:02 Killion\nThank you so much.\n00:08:05 Collins\nDo you have any short-term goals or steps that you're working on to move toward your desired career?\n00:08:10 Killion\nYes, I have quite a lot of them. Because, first of all.\n00:08:21 Killion\nThe career I chose for myself.\n00:08:25 Killion\nRequires a lot of self-discipline.\n00:08:28 Collins\nYes.\n00:08:29 Killion\nAnd self-goals.\n00:08:31 Killion\nSo one of my goals is that.\n00:08:35 Killion\nIn order to get a chance in the market in the future.\n00:08:45 Killion\nI must acquire the required skills and by the required skills, it doesn't mean that.\n00:08:51 Killion\nThe normal skills I get from class or the few lectures, but I end up.\n00:09:02 Killion\nTrying to normal.\n00:09:05 Killion\nAbout the career path I chose.\n00:09:09 - Collins\nSecondly.\n00:09:14 - Collins\nMy goal is.\n00:09:18 - Collins\nLike.\n00:09:23 - Collins\nLet's say you know in software engineering, in order for you to become a software engineer, you must have some specific.\n00:09:34 - Collins\nLanguages you must know you can't manage to do all of them.\n00:09:40 - Collins\nSo myself, I've set my goal that by the end of my second year studies, I would have acquired the necessary skills required.\n00:09:51 - Collins\nTo perform well or.\n00:09:54 - Collins\nProgram using Java and Python.\n00:09:59 - Collins\nOK.\n00:10:02 - Collins\nThat's another one. Another goal of mine, I think those.\n00:10:08 - Collins\nAre the basic ones.\n00:10:11 - Collins\nUnless you want detailed.\n00:10:12 - Killion\nNo, I think that just mentions.\n00:10:17 - Killion\nIt in a better way really.\n00:10:20 - Killion\nJust to maybe follow up if these goals have changed over time or if you've always been focused on this path of software engineering or tech.\n00:10:36 - Collins\nAny paddle please?\n00:10:38 - Killion\nI'm wondering if.\n00:10:41 - Killion\nThese your goals have changed overtime, or if you've always been focused on this same path of software engineering or technology.\n00:10:45 - Collins\nYeah.\n00:10:54 - Collins\nYeah, actually at the time, I always had the desire to engage myself in business.\n00:11:05 - Collins\nAnd like I see the.\n00:11:07 - Collins\nIn the world, many people.\n00:11:09 - Collins\nPeople are currently involved in businesses opening large businesses in different towns, and I see them quite successfully, so sometimes it becomes a challenge like I see.\n00:11:24 - Collins\nMaybe the path I'm taking might be very long, yet I can.\n00:11:30 - Collins\nStart myself some business and prosper in life.\n00:11:33 - Collins\nBut that doesn't hinder me from continuing my.\n00:11:38 - Collins\nCareer.\n00:11:40 - Collins\nIt is something I really feel like I need to achieve.\n00:11:45 - Collins\nYes, yes.\n00:11:48 - Killion\nWell, that's so great to hear, Kilian.\n00:11:52 - Killion\nWell, I'd like to understand the reasons why you settled on software.\n00:11:57 - Killion\nMaybe your motivations and influences, what really inspired you to choose your current field of study?\n00:12:05 - Killion\nOr career.\n00:12:05 - Killion\nWas it just a passion?\n00:12:07 - Killion\nA specific experience or other factors?\n00:12:13 - Collins\nAnd so, first of all, my inspiration at first before I chose this path was.\n00:12:23 - Collins\nI had this curiosity of knowing how.\n00:12:27 - Collins\nThe programs we use in our phones, in our computers, how they work, that's something that.\n00:12:35 - Collins\nKept me wondering, how do these things work so?\n00:12:40 - Collins\nThrough a few friends of mine.\n00:12:43 - Collins\nAnd some of my seniors, I got to know, I got to know that it's all about programming and.\n00:12:52 - Collins\nThat that's what has been pushing me. Like I really need to understand.\n00:12:59 - Collins\nOK.\n00:13:00 - Collins\nOh, these things work out.\n00:13:03 - Killion\nSo it was somewhat curiosity which drove.\n00:13:10 - Killion\nWhich?\n00:13:10 - Collins\nYeah.\n00:13:11 - Killion\nWhich actually drove you to that, should I say passion or something into tech, yeah.\n00:13:18 - Collins\nYeah, it came from curiosity to passion.\n00:13:22 - Collins\nI became so passionate about.\n00:13:25 - Collins\nSoftware engineering.\n00:13:27 - Killion\nYeah, correct.\n00:13:27 - Collins\nGreat.\n00:13:29 - Killion\nSo are there people in your life? Let's talk about maybe your family, some friends or maybe mentors who have worked in a similar field of tech.\n00:13:40 - Killion\nAnd if so, have they influenced your decisions?\n00:13:47 - Collins\nYeah.\n00:13:50 - Collins\nIn my family, I think not that I think I'm the actually, I'm actually the first one to explore the world of tech.\n00:14:01 - Collins\nBut when it comes to friends, I have quite a number of friends.\n00:14:08 - Collins\nWho motivated me?\n00:14:11 - Collins\nTo take this path because at first I thought computer science.\n00:14:20 - Collins\nWas the best.\n00:14:22 - Collins\nBut after getting advice from a few friends who are ahead of me, I actually decided to settle in software engineering.\n00:14:34 - Killion\nWell, now I know.\n00:14:38 - Killion\nSo what are some of the sources of information that have actually helped you to make decisions around this choice?\n00:14:47 - Killion\nFor example, have you relied on guidance from school counselors or your family?\n00:14:53 - Killion\nOr the Internet or any other source?\n00:14:59 - Collins\nYeah, first of all.\n00:15:02 - Collins\nMy family has been a very, very great inspiration 'cause they keep on me being the first one exploring the field. They also want to learn more about me.\n00:15:14 - Collins\nAbout from me so that.\n00:15:16 - Collins\nKeeps me pushing.\n00:15:19 - Collins\nMuch so that when I go there and they ask me, can you help us with this? I actually find a way to help them and.\n00:15:29 - Collins\nSecondly.\n00:15:31 - Collins\nI am one of my lecturers.\n00:15:35 - Collins\nLesbian. Very, very great inspiration and has been supporting.\n00:15:40 - Collins\nThroughout my education, which makes me see myself.\n00:15:45 - Collins\nAt a good place in the future.\n00:15:48 - Killion\nWow, OK.\n00:15:49 - Killion\nWell, that sounds so.\n00:15:51 - Killion\nNow on to our last.\n00:15:52 - Killion\nKylian, I know you must have a battle between maybe wanting to know which is the best career to settle on, you know.\n00:16:02 - Killion\nEspecially after graduating from your school and after receiving your.\n00:16:06 - Killion\nYou know, perhaps you wanted to know is software really the best for me or is maybe medicine really the best course for me?\n00:16:15 - Killion\nI'm just interested in understanding if.\n00:16:19 - Killion\nYou faced any challenge or maybe uncertainties when making your career decisions and if that was so, how did you overcome them?\n00:16:31 - Collins\nYeah. Thank.\n00:16:32 - Collins\nSo first of all, when it came to choosing the career.\n00:16:39 - Collins\nI had quite a number of.\n00:16:43 - Collins\nAdequate number of courses to choose from because I was passionate about computing. But computing is very large so.\n00:16:53 - Collins\nAt first I didn't have the knowledge.\n00:16:58 - Collins\nWhat? Let's say it does.\n00:17:00 - Collins\nWhat's the difference between it information science and technology?\n00:17:05 - Collins\nWhat's the difference between software engineering and computer science?\n00:17:10 - Collins\nComputer science and applied computer science.\n00:17:13 - Collins\nSo it was somehow.\n00:17:17 - Collins\nAt first.\n00:17:19 - Collins\nA challenge, but after quite a good after quite.\n00:17:24 - Collins\nResearch and consultation from a few friends of my parents.\n00:17:33 - Collins\nMy high school teachers, I got to understand the difference between.\n00:17:39 - Collins\nEach and how each work, where they are applied.\n00:17:43 - Collins\nAnd that's when I came.\n00:17:46 - Collins\nTo my choice.\n00:17:48 - Killion\nWell, that's, that's interesting, that's.\n00:17:53 - Killion\nSo thank you so much for your time, Gillian. That's actually it.\n00:17:56 - Killion\nActually, the end of our survey.\n00:18:00 - Killion\nThank you for sharing your thoughts and your insights are very valuable towards our.\n\n"

Can you hear me?\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): Yes. kindly come up again.\nCollins Otieno: Do you have any questions before we begin?\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): Still no questions. You can just start me off.\nCollins Otieno: All I hope you got the first part of my introduction. Right. Interesting.\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): Yes. Yes. yes. Okay.\nCollins Otieno: So, I'm interested in understanding your background information. Could you tell me a bit about yourself and what you're currently doing?\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): my introductory part I am novel madam sautiano and I've just finished high school in Kanga high school that is last year the year 2024 and currently I am doing some doing I'm helping out my aunt and my small sponsor in as girls boarding is a comprehensive school based on the BC curriculum and…\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): that is what I'm working under of the school.\nCollins Otieno: Interesting.\nCollins Otieno: That's so interesting. Mark, what level of education have you completed so far?\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): So far I've been able to enroll from nursery school to primary school in father sca which is also in Asumbi.\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): Then I joined Kanga High School in the year 2021 and finished last year 2024. That is what my level as per now.\nCollins Otieno: Let's get into your career aspirations and…\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): the work I'm seeing myself doing in the future career spirit I stand today is low…\nCollins Otieno: choices. what kind of work do you see yourself doing in the future?\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): what I see myself doing in the future is helping the society to be able to transform people in order to build our economy as A typical day.\nCollins Otieno: Okay. that's very interesting.\nCollins Otieno: And Could you describe what a typical day might look like in this career? Yeah.\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): maybe what I would say is in the pursuit of doing law according to what I understand now is being able to perceive knowledge in a different dimension in order to enable clients to understand that whatever we are trying to do is create an environment where we can associate well with other  We can make the amendment of what we are trying to do to be positive because positivity is the mindset and remember the mind is where we win the battles and so it is to enable clients to understand that law is just being corrupt it is about making transformation in our country also. Yes.\nCollins Otieno: I see. when did you first u start thinking about these career paths?\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): Yeah. it never came that certain because you realize even in high school I never did history. I did computer and what drove me to this was now the leadership progress that I was trying to create.  the environment of leadership that I was trying to create in school. That is what now drove me into this career path because the leadership dimension I had to in school the influence now it created that pathway and so when I settled down with my parents I realized that I could transform the lives of Kenyans and also my life in the law pursuit. Yes.\nCollins Otieno: H okay that's very interesting to hear.\nCollins Otieno: How did you get to learn about these career path? there are sources of information that you're using. Mhm.\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): Currently you realize yes I've not enrolled for any…\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): but I've been doing research on previous lawyers people like Nelson Harvey.\n00:05:00\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): I was doing his research yesterday night. I've also been following people like Pumba because he's one of my great influencers in the law and I've been doing on what do they speak and how are they influential how do they think this society yes that is what that is the process I do\nCollins Otieno: I see.\nCollins Otieno: And these are the information that have actually helped you to make your decision along this career path. Now I'm interested to know how you came to verify or crossch check this information when you talk about people like PLO. So how did you come to verify or cross check?\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): Kindly repeat the question.\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): I'll be di repeat the question.\nCollins Otieno: How did you verify or…\nCollins Otieno: crossch checkck the information to be sure that that's really what you want to do and that's the line that you want to be in?\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): Okay. What…\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): what made me if there's one context that po Lumumba says that you cannot be a leader unless you mentor other people. If you want to be a leader you should have mentored other people.\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): so to me even doing the organization things being in the better others doing the starting foundation we are supposed to be mentoring other people into the line the line of leadership that is why to step with the people like pumumba and realize that there's something that the society needs other than just the normal leadership that every leader has been providing and so that is why  I started following what does Lumumba say?\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): What does Nson have in people like Fambo the LSK president currently what do they have and are they changing the society now you see yes okay I've not been able to know much about it…\nCollins Otieno: Yeah. Mhm.\nCollins Otieno: I see. what do you know about this career in Kenya?\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): because you also realize that I'm also fixed into people like Jon Harvey but what I know about this career in Kenya it is difficult and there's some that Lumumba says that in Kenya it is very difficult to be on the honest part of issues you realize it is a dangerous game actually but even though it is difficult it is possible that is the thing it is possible and…\nCollins Otieno: Okay. …\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): that I use yes\nCollins Otieno: so when you mention difficult,…\nCollins Otieno: what do you mean? Could you love to talk more about that?\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): Yeah. …\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): what I would say is one you realize that the society that we live in now is based on many issues. Among one one I will mention that has been mentioned all through if you look at news is the areas of corruption and so you realize that lawyers deal with these issues and you realize that even if you want to become a prominent lawyer it means you have dealt with corrupt issues and moreo you are als you are always on the negative side defending the people who are corrupt and that is why it is dangerous and it is the\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): the most difficult part because it is a dangerous game you are trying to play. Yes. Okay.\nCollins Otieno: Interesting. …\nCollins Otieno: what have you learned about the job market for this career?\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): I've learned about the job I was trying to look at how do they try to pay what is the net worth of these great guys and I learned one thing that if the job only come in any industry the job market is available when you are influential and when you are in fact everything starts and begins when you show value to somebody what is your value able to win my\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): That is what gives you the job market and gets you to the top of the things. Are you able to win my case? That is the answer. If you able to win my case, then I'm not ready to fail in the case.\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): Because I've used millions to be able to be fighting these cases. So, I need somebody who can get me to the top and who can win my case. That is the point.\nCollins Otieno: Okay.\nCollins Otieno: Very interesting,…\nCollins Otieno: What do you know about the typical compensation?\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): Yes. okay.\n00:10:00\nCollins Otieno: What do you know about the typical compensation in the salary. Yeah. Mhm.\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): I not be able to understand the term because I'm not used to it. But yeah. Okay.\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): just as I've told you when it gets to salary your salary increases at any point in any industry any place of any field of work you're working your salary inreases according to the value are able to create…\nCollins Otieno: She would have done\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): because in most what you are able to do everybody is able to work but the thing is are you able to work and win. That is the completion of the sentence and that is how the salary gets to be added because when I see your value when I see that you are not just hardworking you are more than hardworking and you are working smart to win then salary increases and I was looking and not just that if you are able to climb up the leadership positions of each and every field then automatically your salary increases.\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): I could give you an example the salary there's some difference between the salary of a teacher and…\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): a senior principal there's also some difference between the salary of a senior principal and a chief principal you see and that is the difference because there's some value in between the lines that is the top salary yeah that information I learned in school…\nCollins Otieno: Okay.\nCollins Otieno: How did you get to learn about that information?\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): because I was now equipped into the school leadership system. I could sit with my chief principal sir Ruben Kyang and there are some things we could talk out of the leadership progress we could now talk out about what do you do aside from school how do you manage to I also spoke to people like Mr.\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): Kabaraka before he left for being the principal at the edom mixed and he could share with these things that if you want some things you have to be on top automatically you get what you want because everybody in Kenya everybody's after being in the market and more so creating the economy zones and being able to fulfill your pocket and being to be on the top it means there is some value creating and you realize that they are segmented into different positions. So it means you have to climb the ladder from one step to another in order to get the salary difference between this one person and another person that has to be there. Yes.\nCollins Otieno: Wow, that's very u interesting Mark and I really appreciate how comprehensive the information you give me is and…\nCollins Otieno: very quickly just let's walk into your influences and decision making  Could you walk me through how you came to consider this part?\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): One of the ways…\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): because I realized as I was in high school I was into the path of technology because I saw the world is transforming in terms of technology.\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): not people the world was transforming in terms of technology you realize that computer systems are being remodernized into different shapes and I wanted to do computer science but how did I now relocate my idea into law there's a good friend of mine was my assistant he's been a one guy working with me there's some seminar we happen to have attended\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): together in Kith concerning the youth draft bill and when we were asked now there's some tendency we have that after we are done with the seminars we now must speak to the top cream so that we understand how did they get there what do they do you see and so Henry mentioned law and to me I also mentioned computer science and you realize the society also takes you according to what you have said\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): had to become when I say that there is this dream that I like mentioning to each and every place I go the dream of the presidency in the year 2042 and these people now tell me and they ask me how are you able to conform yourself yes there's some idea when you try to make Kenya look in terms of technology but are you able to convince yourself into it and now what made me more\n00:15:00\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): So apart from the influence of my friend Henry of course I've been watching our place they do watch TV there's a program there it's called ratil every Sunday where they call different people to talk about the Kenya's economy how Kenya is transforming in terms of economy and these people most of them who are called lawyers and if you're not called if you are a person who is\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): and you're not a lawyer. Arguing with these people is difficult because they will take you through the paths of the constitution. If you're not able to understand the constitution then in that program now there's some kind of mindset that they bring that this person doesn't understand clearly what he's saying because they try now to bring you to the issue they dig down upon issues of the constitution.  So it means you must understand that this law are you able to conform the constitution into your brain. Are you able to understand matters dealing with humanitarian issues under the constitution?\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): and that is what now drove me and I said I must walk clearly into the law and I must now know what can I do so that one day I believe that what I have be called to these programs many of them am I able to defend myself under the constitution and that is why I now draw my line and say then I'm to do law clearly and if I'm to go back to school I'll do computer science as a second degree\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): Yes. Okay.\nCollins Otieno: Interesting. I see.\nCollins Otieno: Mark, who do you talk to about your career aspirations or your career plans?\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): I talk mostly to my parent and my guardian and we to chat way forward because she has mentored a lot of people on the way and I've seen some of these guys.\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): So I've been speaking to her about the career and she also decided to sponsor me along the university coastline on the issues based on the law and apart from that I've been speaking also to my very great uncle he's a businessman in fact he's the first person who now gave me the idea after I sent him a video when I spoke in an auditorium in Kisumu and he told me you are able to do law very well then also  My friends have mentioned one of them is Henry. So I'm speaking to different people so that I understand that what is their perception to this course and what is now their perception when they include me into this course. Am I able to bring transformation into the society in our community and even our nation or even globally.\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): So those are few people I speak to friends family and I tell them what I can be able to do and how much transformation I can be able to bring back to the society at the end of the day. Yes. anyone as in from who?\nCollins Otieno: someone who is in the same field from anywhere that you're very close.\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): My uncle currently is doing I don't know he told me the third degree. That uncle who advised me now is doing law in University of Nairobi as his third degree. Yes.\nCollins Otieno: And what have you really learned from him?\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): there is the one thing in fact is the guy…\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): who took me to Kanga High School the first day that we there for admission and…\nCollins Otieno: Mhm. Yeah.\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): there's one word that he left me with that your network is your network and you cannot build a network if you don't have the ability to talk and…\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): the ability to influence people. that is what I cannot say it has affected me.\nCollins Otieno: Yeah. Mhm.\nCollins Otieno: H And has knowing him affected your career plans in any way?\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): Yes. I don't know how to locate. Yes.\nCollins Otieno: I wish we\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): In any way it has not influenced my because you realize if you ask people who have finished form four for now people are confused in terms of courses and you realize that the moment you are confused in terms of courses then moving along the six year path it becomes difficult.\n00:20:00\nCollins Otieno: Mhm.\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): For me changing faster from computer science to law was very easy because I was openminded and you realize positivity is the mindset. So that was the goal and that is why shifting very fast was it never affected me. I never sat somewhere and thought of it. No, I just came and say in fact I've been great because leadership progress along the school side also enabled me.\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): In fact, I regretted leaving history because now I say history I wanted to be a leader.\nCollins Otieno: that's\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): Leadership line came across in form for form three and form four and so it drove a line. So it also disturbed me. So when I realized you could do law yet you never did this. In fact, it was one of my happiest moments. confing very fast and shifting. Yes.\nCollins Otieno: Almost my last questions. what role…\nCollins Otieno: if any has your family played in your career planning?\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): the role that the family has played is 75% of it is the advice and…\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): also 25% of it is the sponsorship because education is the game changer calling if you're not educated then you are not able to do many things. Yes. So the family has played role in terms of education. Sponsoring educated is that is the greatest thing the family has held me out and also advising me because they telling me you want to be a leader. These people have been the people that's why I was telling you and it is a difficult game. They're telling me you could get killed anytime.\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): But I'm telling them I'm secure…\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): because I'm learning. As I grow, I also expose myself and I also know how to evade such things. Yes. they have shocked me…\nCollins Otieno: Okay.\nCollins Otieno: And my very last question, how have your educational experiences shaped your career interests?\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): because you realize law is about conviction. colle to convince the judge that this person didn't murder even if he did it. Law is about conviction and for you to be able to convince somebody it means you are able to talk you are able to influence it is called Are you able to influence that person on a career some on a topic?\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): Are you able to influence the honor the judge or those people? Are you able to influence that person that this person never did it?\nCollins Otieno: What's up?\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): So it's about education building me according to facts that this is what education has transformed me in the way that I even speak now. I speak good English because of education. So that is how education has played the role and also the thing that education has done is exposing me to the different abilities, different opportunities to be able to and that is why I view law even if it is thought to be dangerous.\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): I view it in another perspective. education has made open-minded. Am I able to think positively in Everything that is brought by mankind, it has negativity. But are you able to view things on the positive side of that negative? Because 50% everything even the computer it has the negative side of it needs to be updated.\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): Are you able to work on the part of when it is not it is now outdated?\nCollins Otieno: Yeah. Yeah.\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): You get the fact. So dealing on the positive side of matters it has come along the experience of being in school experience of being educated and the experience that I can be able to transform other people's life because of education.\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): education it has really created a major impact in life. Yes. One of the…\nCollins Otieno: Okay. what challenges do you anticipate in this career?\nCollins Otieno: It's  Just one music.\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): what we see as let me say it's now public because most of these cases that they talk and they news so you will get back to your account for example I'm on Instagram I'm on Facebook so I'm ready\n00:25:00\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): to get feedback. this time mark you never did well. You were supposed to do this yet and you cannot also be able to defend the fact that we are able to win all cases.\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): There are some cases that you are not able to win not because you can't but because of circumstances. So chances are there one of them you cannot win all cases because you are not God. You cannot win all cases. Number two, there are some will be dealing with the public on your social media platform.\nCollins Otieno: I knew the four Okay.\nCollins Otieno: Okay, Mark. So, finally, what resources or support would be helpful for you?\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): Yes. Yeah.\nCollins Otieno: What resources or support would be helpful for you in pursuing your career?\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): Major reason is in terms of am I able to go through the whole four years because some people…\nCollins Otieno: Okay.\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): but along the way challenges maybe resources the influential resources is financial aid in the universities. You can start this second year, but you can quit not because you wanted to quit but because of financial aid is the major resource that if you are able to get then you'll complete the four years course very well and get a degree and as you also in turn try to look for the job opportunity you can enroll back for the master.\nMac Adams (President Mac Adams): So the major challenge here is the financial resource. It is 75% people are willing to go to school but the financial resource limited Thank you.\nCollins Otieno: thank you so much Mark for your time and for the responses that you've given and they're very helpful responses for the purposes of this research. So we've just come to the end of it all and u I want to thank you once again and wish you a wonderful day ahead. All right. Thank you.

And before we begin, I just want to let you know that this is a short survey to understand the aspirations and motivations of African students.\n00:00:27 - Collins\nYeah. So your responses will be kept confidential and will only be used for research purposes.\n00:00:37 - Collins\nOur session should take approximately 10 minutes, and I'll be asking you some questions about your studies, your career goals, and the motivations behind your choices.\n00:00:50 - Collins\nSo feel free to answer as openly as you're comfortable with.\n00:01:00 - Collins\nAlright, so thank you. Let's start with a little introduction about yourself.\n00:01:03 - Collins\nYou may want to talk about your educational background.\n00:01:13 - Collins\nBasically, the program of study at university at the moment.\n00:01:22 - Manuela\nOK, my name is Manuela. I studied at...\n00:01:28 - Manuela\nI went to high school and got a...\n00:01:32 - Manuela\n...minus CKC.\n00:01:36 - Manuela\nAnd currently, I'm at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology.\n00:01:43 - Manuela\nI am studying quantity surveying.\n00:01:46 - Collins\nOh, wow.\n00:01:47 - Collins\nThank you for sharing that.\n00:01:50 - Collins\nI'll just move to our next question.\n00:01:54 - Collins\nI'm actually wondering if you could tell me about the schools or institutions that you've attended before joining JKUAT, and maybe how these schools have influenced your current educational path?\n00:02:11 - Manuela\nSo I attended my secondary school at Alliance Girls High School.\n00:02:16 - Manuela\nAt Alliance Girls, I took Art and Design, and Art and Design is one of the things that influenced my career choice.\n00:02:29 - Manuela\nWhen I entered Alliance Girls, I initially wanted to do medicine.\n00:02:37 - Manuela\nBut after interacting with students and teachers, especially in my art classes, I realized I wanted my course to involve something creative, and this was something I really liked.\n00:02:57 - Manuela\nAt the same time, I found myself being drawn to renovation and building and construction shows such as Amazing Engineering on National Geographic, and \"Europe From Above\" on Discovery Family.\n00:03:19 - Manuela\nThis really helped shape my decision.\n00:03:26 - Collins\nWell, I'm so glad to hear that you were inspired by your interactions and experiences. That’s very interesting! Let’s talk about your future now.\n00:03:41 - Collins\nI’d love to hear about your career aspirations. Could you mention your long-term career goals or the kind of work that you envision yourself doing after graduation?\n00:04:00 - Collins\nWhat is your vision for your future?\n00:04:03 - Manuela\nOK, so my course in quantity surveying is quite a wide field. It deals with building economics but can also work in a lot of fields since it's essentially about economics.\n00:04:18 - Manuela\nI plan to stay in the construction industry for around 10 or 20 years before eventually branching out to become an arts teacher at the secondary school level.\n00:04:45 - Manuela\nWhile doing my PhD to be able to lecture at any university.\n00:04:54 - Collins\nWell, that's so interesting! I really wish you well in your current and future endeavors. It's amazing to hear that you might want to be a lecturer in the future.\n00:05:04 - Collins\nHave your goals changed over time, or have you always been focused on this path?\n00:05:19 - Manuela\nMy goals did change over time. Initially, my mission was to stay in the corporate world, but I later discovered that the corporate world wasn’t exactly for me.\n00:05:37 - Manuela\nAs I continued to discover myself, I realized I have a passion for teaching art. I like gaining knowledge and sharing it.\n00:05:52 - Manuela\nSo I realized that eventually, I’d like to end up like my current mentor, Mrs. Karani, who was my art teacher in high school.\n00:06:01 - Manuela\nAnd that’s the path I plan to take.\n00:06:07 - Collins\nWow, that’s amazing! You’ve actually mentioned something that I was going to ask actually because I really want to understand the reason why you were making this career choice. Sorry.\n00:06:21 Collins:\nSo you've talked about mentor and?\n00:06:26 Collins:\nI'm wondering if the people in your life, such as your family, your friends, or mentors who have worked in a similar field, and if so, how did they influence your decisions?\n00:06:40 Manuela:\nSo my mentor is my high school teacher.\n00:06:44 Manuela:\nCalled Missus Kalani.\n00:06:46 Manuela:\nSo I met Missus Karani when we were in Form 1 and she guided me through art and after realizing I have the talent.\n00:06:55 Manuela:\nAnd she used to talk to us and advise on how and why.\n00:07:02 Manuela:\nWe use this art as a career subject, cause most of the time in Kenya, most of the career stem subjects are considered to be career subjects rather than art.\n00:07:17 Manuela:\nSo after she used to tell us which fields you can find yourself in, the most common field being architecture, but I...\n00:07:26 Manuela:\nDecided to go for quantity surveying since it had both art and mathematics elements.\n00:07:34 Manuela:\nWhile she also encouraged us to not only have one life goal.\n00:07:42 Manuela:\nSo as you can see, I'm aspiring to be both a QS and a teacher.\n00:07:47 Collins:\nYes.\n00:07:48 Manuela:\n'Cause you can find yourself in a lot of...\n00:07:50 Manuela:\nSo as much as I'm doing my degree in quantity surveying, I'm still out looking for...\n00:07:58 Manuela:\nA...\n00:07:59 Manuela:\nI'm still out looking for a lot more, mostly art-oriented.\n00:08:05 Manuela:\nYeah.\n00:08:08 Collins:\nWell, you have a very interesting story and passion, really for what you're doing and that is what is really needed.\n00:08:16 Collins:\nI think so.\n00:08:18 Collins:\nI just want to know if you have any stories that maybe shaped your inspirations in the space of quantity survey and art or teaching as you mentioned.\n00:08:31 Manuela:\nPardon.\n00:08:32 Collins:\nI'm wondering if you've encountered any stories that shaped your aspirations in the space that you currently in.\n00:08:41 Manuela:\nI have.\n00:08:42 Manuela:\nI have.\n00:08:45 Collins:\nWould you like to talk about it?\n00:08:49 Manuela:\nYeah. So the story that shaped how I got into quantity survey.\n00:08:53 Manuela:\nThank you.\n00:08:56 Manuela:\nSo as I told you, the most common field to get into as an artist in Kenya is architecture.\n00:09:04 Manuela:\nSo I actually checked how architectural courses are taught.\n00:09:12 Manuela:\nI interacted with a few architects and realized that as much as architecture is amazing.\n00:09:21 Manuela:\nThe process and the teaching kind of kills the artist in you.\n00:09:30 Manuela:\nSo I wanted a course that had art elements of architecture but still let me maintain being a fine artist.\n00:09:40 Manuela:\nSo with that, I found the middle ground to take quantity surveying.\n00:09:46 Manuela:\nSo the course actually, during our first two years of study, we study architecture, we study the buildings and everything involving architecture.\n00:09:56 Manuela:\nAnd then in the third year, we branched to mathematics.\n00:10:00 Manuela:\nSo this course takes four years, while architecture in Canada takes six years.\n00:10:05 Manuela:\nYes.\n00:10:06 Manuela:\nYes, yes. So with this.\n00:10:09 Manuela:\nI find myself having a head start.\n00:10:13 Manuela:\nIn the construction industry.\n00:10:17 Manuela:\nThen also having time to pursue fine art.\n00:10:21 Manuela:\nAnd the story that the story that shaped my wanting to be a teacher, and this is something I realized a bit later, this is actually not involved in art, but rather in my high school. I used to be the chemistry representative.\n00:10:35 Manuela:\nAnd due to unavoidable circumstances, I found myself teaching the class.\n00:10:44 Manuela:\nWhen the teacher was unavailable and covering a lot of the classes actually. So with this I realized I love.\n00:10:55 Manuela:\nI love the planning.\n00:10:57 Manuela:\nAnd actually reading ahead, learning the knowledge, planning and then finally sharing, I also realized I have a talent in sharing and guidance at the same time. We had our KCSC projects, we were doing some KCSC projects in.\n00:11:14 Manuela:\nHow, when, when was it?\n00:11:17 Manuela:\nIt was around three months before KCAC we officially start our ad projects and a lot of the students used to come to me for guidance when I know what, what is this Manila?\n00:11:28 Manuela:\nCan I improve?\n00:11:29 Manuela:\nHow can they sell this and they?\n00:11:31 Manuela:\nI found myself.\n00:11:32 Manuela:\nBeing a teacher, kind of.\n00:11:35 Manuela:\nIt was really interesting and I realized I really love noticing and sharing.\n00:11:41 Collins:\nHmm.\n00:11:42 Manuela:\nAnd the final story was actually my progress in art from how I got, I got to Form 1 and by the time I got to, by the time I got to Form 4.\n00:11:53 Manuela:\nMy art was amazing.\n00:11:56 Manuela:\nSo I had the talent.\n00:12:00 Manuela:\nBut the tips?\n00:12:01 Manuela:\nHad been shared in art class.\n00:12:04 Manuela:\nIs something I realized that this actually helps shape artists, and these are tips I used to get and I would love to share them with other people so that they can improve their art. Yeah.\n00:12:17 Collins:\nWell, I'm just so excited to listen to your, should I say, inspirational stories. I mean, they're just so.\n00:12:25 Collins:\nAnd maybe after this session, I'd like to engage more with you, because I also realize that you're someone who likes teaching other people.\n00:12:34 Collins:\nMaybe you may want to.\n00:12:36 Collins:\nAlso, teach me some little art after this session or some other time.\n00:12:41 Collins:\nThank you so much for sharing that.\n00:12:44 Collins:\nI'm just wondering if there's some sources of information that actually helped you to make decisions around.\n00:12:50 Collins:\nYour career choice, for example, you may want to talk about.\n00:12:54 Collins:\nMaybe getting guidance from your school counselors, or maybe your family.\n00:12:59 Collins:\nMaybe used to the?\n00:13:01 Collins:\nOr just any other sources that have helped you make a decision in this field.\n00:13:09 Manuela:\nYeah. So unfortunately there wasn't a lot of guidance from school in choosing our careers.\n00:13:16 Manuela:\nWe had a.\n00:13:17 Manuela:\nLot of career talks and these forms we had to.\n00:13:24 Manuela:\nKnow which career path you take, but.\n00:13:28 Manuela:\nThe career paths are usually very.\n00:13:30 Manuela:\nYou are either a doctor, a lawyer, an architect, or maybe a pilot.\n00:13:36 Collins:\nYeah.\n00:13:37 Manuela:\nSo you'd find that something like QS which is.\n00:13:41 Manuela:\nIt's not something that's very common or very known, so it's very hard to get into.\n00:13:46 Manuela:\nA career so my.\n00:13:49 Manuela:\nPlay.\n00:13:50 Manuela:\nYeah. So my influence was mostly from.\n00:13:53 Manuela:\nThe family and shows OK.\n00:13:56 Collins:\nYeah. Well, that's so great to hear.\n00:14:00 Collins:\nAnd now on to my last question.\n00:14:03 Collins:\nHave you faced any uncertainties? Because initially previously I think I had you mention something to do with wanting to be a medical doctor, getting to the medical space.\n00:14:16 Collins:\nAnd now?\n00:14:17 Collins:\nHere into the QS and you also want to.\n00:14:21 Collins:\nUAE in the field of art and now you want to be a teacher as well.\n00:14:27 Collins:\nDid you face any challenges or rather uncertainties when making this decision of settling into art and yeah.\n00:14:36 Manuela:\nI actually faced a lot of unsatisfactory.\n00:14:50 Manuela:\nYeah.\n00:14:52 Manuela:\nI had at first getting in Form 1 and being a bright student. The expectation was to be a doctor.\n00:15:03 Manuela:\nHey.\n00:15:03 Manuela:\nBut once I got there and studied and did biology, I realized this is not where I want to be.\n00:15:12 Manuela:\nYeah.\n00:15:14 Manuela:\nYeah, but.\n00:15:15 Manuela:\nWas still not very certain where I'm going.\n00:15:18 Manuela:\nCause architecture seemed like a.\n00:15:19 Manuela:\nWell, that was the film that seemed to be the closest option.\n00:15:23 Manuela:\nWhat I wanted mm.\n00:15:26 Manuela:\nSo between from 2:00 and from three, I was very uncertain on what I'm going to do, but luckily for me, I had a very supportive sister.\n00:15:35 Manuela:\nWe thought about we wrote down 5 courses, I don't remember.\n00:15:40 Manuela:\nWhich other courses we?\n00:15:42 Manuela:\nBut I remember quantity survey was among the courses we wrote.\n00:15:46 Manuela:\nAnd then I went and did.\n00:15:47 Manuela:\nOn which is which.\n00:15:49 Manuela:\nThank you.\n00:15:50 Manuela:\nBefore finally landing in quantity surveying. But this took a while and the years before I realized I wanted to be in the construction industry.\n00:16:01 Manuela:\nSo by the time I realized there was about, it was only four, four, and time. You were supposed to fill these forms.\n00:16:10 Manuela:\nFor your career, and I actually had to make a decision at that time.\n00:16:14 Manuela:\nStill wasn't sure whether this is.\n00:16:16 Manuela:\nWhere I want to be.\n00:16:19 Manuela:\nBut I feel as nonetheless.\n00:16:22 Manuela:\nAnd I'm I'm happy with my choice.\n00:16:25 Collins:\nWell, thank you so much for sharing such insightful thoughts, you know, and I'm just so excited that we are coming to the end of this and you shared just a lot, a lot of information.\n00:16:40 Collins:\nSo it's actually the end of our interview, or rather session and.\n\n"

A specific experience or just other factors?\n00:06:24 Marvel\nIt really started.\n00:06:26 Marvel\nIt's really it started so finally like I had this question like I was being told by someone that you have a great voice.\n00:06:36 Marvel\nOK. And with your voice, your voice can take you somewhere far.\n00:06:41 Marvel\nAnd so the way I used to.\n00:06:45 Marvel\nAnd how I could address issues?\n00:06:47 Marvel\nMm hmm and make.\n00:06:50 Marvel\nAnd some issues like being a leader, it takes it.\n00:06:54 Marvel\nIt takes a lot.\n00:06:55 Marvel\nYou have to solve.\n00:06:57 Marvel\nYou have to know what to do.\n00:06:59 Marvel\nHave to.\n00:07:00 Marvel\nBe a good.\n00:07:01 Marvel\nSo in most cases, I used to solve issues, so that made me so strong and so fit that I decided to pursue law as a career.\n00:07:12 Collins\nOK.\n00:07:15 Collins\nYeah, that's so great to hear.

There are no right or wrong answers because we're interested in your personal experiences. So this conversation will be recorded for research purposes and…\nMoses Ogenrwot: Yes. Yeah.\nMoses Ogenrwot: Yeah, that's right.\nCollins Otieno: do you have any questions before we begin?\nMoses Ogenrwot: Questions I think they'll come afterwards.\nCollins Otieno: All let's delve into you getting some background information about yourself. Moses, could you tell me a bit about yourself and what you're currently doing?\nMoses Ogenrwot: As probably I'm Moses and…\nMoses Ogenrwot: basically about my background I am Ugandan by nationality. so there's nothing much I can say about my background but just I'm Ugandan and currently I'm studying in USA majoring what data science and analytics. Yeah,…\nCollins Otieno: Yeah, that really helps that introduction.\nMoses Ogenrwot: I think that can come up for the background.\nCollins Otieno: is really helpful. So, what level of education have you completed so far?\nMoses Ogenrwot: So far I've completed high school and currently I'm pursuing my bachelor's degree in data science and…\nCollins Otieno: Mhm. Okay.\nMoses Ogenrwot: analytics. Yeah. Yeah.\nCollins Otieno: Interesting. thank you so much for that background information, Moses. let's get into your career aspirations and choices.\nCollins Otieno: What kind of work do you see yourself doing in the future?\nMoses Ogenrwot: The kind of work I see myself probably to do in the future,…\nMoses Ogenrwot: I think there's nothing more or…\nCollins Otieno: Mhm. Okay.\nMoses Ogenrwot: less like being a data scientist. And probably I can add a data analyst to it.\nCollins Otieno: And that is very interesting. Could you describe …\nCollins Otieno: what a typical day might look like in this career?\nMoses Ogenrwot: Probably.\nMoses Ogenrwot: H. …\nCollins Otieno: Okay, Take your time, Moses.\nMoses Ogenrwot: that's an interesting one. …\nMoses Ogenrwot: ever since I finished high school, I had this desire basically I didn't know that data science existed. I was deep rooted into the traditional, …\nCollins Otieno: Mhm.\nCollins Otieno: Okay,…\nMoses Ogenrwot: statistics and logistics, right?  But now when I came here I got to realize that data scientist and data analysis can do the work that the traditional statistician used to do  So well to answer that question, I think a typical day can either be like I think\nCollins Otieno: let's keep that as you think.\nCollins Otieno: So you may just respond if you have anything to respond around that maybe later. Let me ask when did you first start thinking about this career path?\nMoses Ogenrwot: I think it all started in 2023…\nCollins Otieno: Mhm.\nMoses Ogenrwot: because I was even given advice by my former high school teacher. because he knew me very well right from form one up to form six. Yeah. Cuz he saw my potential. He saw what I am really capable of.  Then he gave me an advice that I think this career can even be the best for Being a data scientist or doing data science can fit you very well.  And I never believed it but when I sat down and I see it by myself and I think through and wow I really even found that I think it's the best thing for me because things like being an engineer let's say a chemical electrical engineer those are things that doesn't fit me and actually I never wanted to do something like that but based on his advice and how he sees what he sees in me that I'm capable of doing things related to data science\nMoses Ogenrwot: and all those.\nMoses Ogenrwot: Yeah, it really inspired me to take that to pursue data science in particular.\nCollins Otieno: That's very interesting to hear.\n00:05:00\nCollins Otieno: Moses, how did you come to learn about this career path?\nMoses Ogenrwot: At first when I got the cause for scholarship at USU that was the first time I landed upon data science…\nCollins Otieno: Okay. Mhm. Mhm.\nMoses Ogenrwot: but then when I got advice from my former teacher as I told you before and there was also another person who also gave me the same advice which was probably my brother-in-law who is pursuing that specific career currently. Yeah. So he gave me advice what the career is all about,…\nMoses Ogenrwot: what data science is all about, what the data scientist do and yeah I really got into me myself I did some research online to find out…\nCollins Otieno: Interesting.\nCollins Otieno: And did you have to use any other sources of information for this purpose?\nMoses Ogenrwot: what data science is all about and… what a data ci  is all those business analyst what they do exactly and based on those findings I really realize that I think that's what I can really do well and I think I can take on that career as part of my life career\nMoses Ogenrwot: \nCollins Otieno: Okay.\nCollins Otieno: I see. How did you come to verify this information?\nCollins Otieno: Now that you talk about having to delve into research, you also mention your meeting some people who had some information about the career.\nCollins Otieno: Did you verify or cross check this information? Mhm. Uhhuh.\nMoses Ogenrwot: Yeah, probably I cross checked.\nMoses Ogenrwot: Yeah, I cross checked with some officials who are already working in that field from Uganda especially those who are working with Uganda bit of statistics. Yeah, they also give me some bit of advice about Yeah.\nCollins Otieno: Interesting.\nMoses Ogenrwot: what I can really make of myself in that part.\nCollins Otieno: What do you know about this career field in Kenya? Yes.\nMoses Ogenrwot: Yeah. In Kenya.\nMoses Ogenrwot: Probably in Kenya I haven't gotten to know so much cuz I haven't taken long. But what I know is the career is it's in high demand currently in Kenya and…\nCollins Otieno: Mhm.\nCollins Otieno: Yes. Mhm.\nMoses Ogenrwot: not only But as for Kenya currently I'm not quite well versed with the career field in Kenya but for Uganda.\nCollins Otieno: Do you want to mention Uganda please?\nMoses Ogenrwot: Yeah I'm okay with the part of Uganda of course. currently there are very many organizations currently in Uganda who requires a business analyst and some extent they require data scientists and…\nMoses Ogenrwot: especially the ones who design this database models all those things Yeah. And especially most businesses nowadays in Uganda, they need business analyst who are especially responsible for making out the business reports, those dashboards, all those things. And I can say everywhere you go, on high demand. every company, they in need of a data analyst or…\nCollins Otieno: Okay.\nCollins Otieno: And …\nMoses Ogenrwot: a data scientist.\nCollins Otieno: what are the qualifications that are really required?\nMoses Ogenrwot: I think that now depends on the exact field you're going to be majoring in because if you to be data scientist, you need to know things concerning machine learning which you have to master it fully. You have to know it very well and then you have to know how to create algorithms all those things.  But now as for a business analyst or a data analyst in particular just need to be well versed with data manipulation and then probably just these things of data visualization. Yeah, if you are okay in those fields then I think you qualify for it.\nCollins Otieno: compensation in this field.\nMoses Ogenrwot: I think that now depends on the company, but most data scientists and data analysts I think they are paid quite well. Yeah. In terms of the wages, they are paid quite well because in Uganda currently you may find a data scientist is earning the lowest amount can be 1.5 million Ugandan shillings.\n00:10:00\nCollins Otieno: Mhm.\nMoses Ogenrwot: Yeah, that's the lowest amount I know for now in Uganda.\nCollins Otieno: So, how much does this equal to? Let's estimate maybe in US dollars.\nMoses Ogenrwot: I don't know much about in US dollar let's say in a month you're getting something like $800 $800.\nCollins Otieno: Interesting. how did you learn about this information?\nMoses Ogenrwot: Okay.\nMoses Ogenrwot: The old point is I have people who are already in that field and the closest person to me is my brother-in-law. Yeah. He's working in that field and the salary he gets even I know the amount. He always tells me the amount and…\nCollins Otieno: Okay.\nMoses Ogenrwot: his salary probably that's why it's a confidential information but I can say it out because his salary is something approximate to 5 million Ugandan shillings per month.\nCollins Otieno: Okay. Mhm. Wow.\nMoses Ogenrwot: So yeah he's just a d analyst. He doesn't do much but he's being paid Allowances being given So I can say that the compensations are Everything is well cut through.\nCollins Otieno: Thank you for that information, Moses.\nCollins Otieno: And thank you for getting even into deeper more sensitive areas like mentioning your brother-in-law's salary.\nMoses Ogenrwot: Yeah. Yes,…\nCollins Otieno: That is quite confidential but I thank you. So how you came to consider this path? Could you walk me through…\nMoses Ogenrwot: please. …\nCollins Otieno: how you came to consider this career path? Mhm. Mhm.\nMoses Ogenrwot: I had a lot of careers like that I wanted to pursue in mind, but probably based on all my findings, I realized data science is something that, I can actually work with. First of all, I considered being an engineer, which doesn't work for me.\nCollins Otieno: Yeah. Mhm.\nMoses Ogenrwot: \nMoses Ogenrwot: You get it? But as soon as I was almost leaving high school then I realized I got to realize what's really best for me especially because I am good at doing things related to computer that's one of the and that's one of the thing which motivated me to pursue a career like data science and another thing was I had that need to solve problems using analytical methods you get and gather information that I was to solve problems especially problems in the society based on my findings…\nMoses Ogenrwot: because as a data scientist or analyst you have to gather like information you have to delve into in the society and find out the root cause of certain problems which as an engineer you not be able to do that quite easily.\nCollins Otieno: Yeah, true.\nMoses Ogenrwot: So yeah, as a data scientist or an analyst, it gives you that opportunity to go and find out the root cause of some problems in the society based on various ways. I can do it manually. I can use a computer to do that. Then I gather my data. Then I find out what's really the cause of this problem. And then I can deise a solution for it based on my findings.\nCollins Otieno: Okay.\nCollins Otieno: Thank you, Moses.\nMoses Ogenrwot: Yeah. …\nCollins Otieno: And are there people that you talk to about your career plans?\nMoses Ogenrwot: there are not very many people cuz things like things like that I always keep it to few people…\nCollins Otieno: Mhm. Okay.\nMoses Ogenrwot: but yeah I always say that to people who see a potential in me is Yeah. Yeah. But there are few. So especially my brother-in-law cuz we always converse a lot about what I really have to do, what I need to do, what my career plans are.\nMoses Ogenrwot: \nCollins Otieno: Mhm. Okay.\nMoses Ogenrwot: Yeah. We always talk about that a lot.\nCollins Otieno: And …\nMoses Ogenrwot: Yeah. …\nCollins Otieno: how do these conversations actually influence your thinking?\nMoses Ogenrwot: over these conversations I think they always make my level of thinking to go higher…\nMoses Ogenrwot: because I say up to some point we discuss future plans and sometimes he always gives me ways of how I can think analytically Yeah. especially you think beyond what I see to do things to think beyond the impossible.\nCollins Otieno: Mhm. Yeah,…\n00:15:00\nMoses Ogenrwot: I hope you get that. Yeah. Yeah.\nCollins Otieno: interesting. so I actually want would like to know if there are any other people who work in this chosen field that Mhm.\nMoses Ogenrwot: There are a few who I know but now most of them I'm not always in touch with them. Yeah. It's only my brother-in-law who I stay with him during the holidays.\nMoses Ogenrwot: Most of the time I'm with him except when I'm here in Kenya.\nCollins Otieno: Okay. Wow,…\nMoses Ogenrwot: Yeah. …\nCollins Otieno: that's great. how has knowing your brother-in-law actually affected your career plans?\nMoses Ogenrwot: I think it has made my career plans even much better because whenever there's any single flow in my plan yeah he always points out now this and…\nCollins Otieno: Mhm.\nMoses Ogenrwot: this may not end and this may not be the right thing. So yeah, he has always made good decisions like depending on what plan exactly I want for my career.\nCollins Otieno: Yeah. …\nMoses Ogenrwot: There's no problem.\nCollins Otieno: what role actually if any has your family played in your career planning?\nMoses Ogenrwot: They haven't played much role, but they gave me advice.\nCollins Otieno: Mhm.\nMoses Ogenrwot: Most of them they give me advice to follow my gut, to follow what I really feel like it's the right thing for me to do. I think that has encouraged me cuz Yeah. Because if you have family, they are ready to support you in the field that you have chosen, which means they really understand you and that Can help you a lot to pursue your career.\nCollins Otieno: Yeah, that's very true.\nMoses Ogenrwot: If you have people who really understands why you chose a given field or why you're pursuing a given career. Yes.\nCollins Otieno: And almost to my last question, Moses, how have your educa you actually mentioned that you've completed high school.\nCollins Otieno: Have your educational experiences shaped your career choices.\nMoses Ogenrwot: According to that…\nMoses Ogenrwot: because I mentioned earlier that before I was almost completing my school I had that need for becoming an engineer.\nCollins Otieno: Yeah. Yes. Yeah.\nMoses Ogenrwot: \nMoses Ogenrwot: You hope you're getting So during the course of my studies I always wanted to be an engineer but I realized and based on the advice people have given me that choose a career that's trending and that's in the near future may dominate and may become maybe dominate like the job market you get.  So based on the advices I think now all my studies all along right from high school has made me to realize that it's always best I should find what's the right thing to do and what's really best for me probably\nMoses Ogenrwot: I see there's going to be much competition. That's what I should know. There's going to be much competition and at some point I believe even the compensation may reduce because as for now there are very many people who are deling into that kind of field especially data science. So I believe at some point the wages of data scientists may have to be cut a bit and there may be a reduction in the wages and…\nMoses Ogenrwot: I think that's may be a challenge cuz as the world is growing the cost of living is increasing so if your wages or salaries are being cut down a bit so it's going to be very difficult to cope up with the standards of living in the future.\nCollins Otieno: Yeah. …\nCollins Otieno: okay. I see. what resources or…\nCollins Otieno: support would you need to help you pursue this career? Mhm.\nMoses Ogenrwot: No.\nMoses Ogenrwot: I think one of them should be I think that's the best thing. guidance if you're being guided, on what to do so that you, can make it to that career path you're pursuing. I think that's the best thing. Yeah. And at some point I think coaching can be relevant\n00:20:00\nMoses Ogenrwot: Coaching by some expert who is already in that field can also be necessary.\nCollins Otieno: Yeah, true.\nCollins Otieno: right.\nMoses Ogenrwot: Yeah. Wow.\nCollins Otieno: Thank you so much for your responses, Moses. as I conclude, is there anything that you'd like to share about your career choice that we haven't mentioned?\nMoses Ogenrwot: Yeah,…\nMoses Ogenrwot: probably. you said based on all my decisions, I feel like, I only want to be a data scientist, not because of few things, but I want to del more into, especially machine learning and artificial intelligence,…\nCollins Otieno: Mhm. Okay.\nMoses Ogenrwot: Yeah, that's the only thing I haven't shared because my major interest was to do something related to artificial intelligence and machine learning. Yeah. …\nCollins Otieno: Interesting. do you have any advice that you would like to give to other young people who are making career decisions?\nMoses Ogenrwot: yeah, probably there's one or…\nCollins Otieno: Mhm.\nMoses Ogenrwot: two I can give to them. Yeah. I think the best thing is they have to follow their gut.\nCollins Otieno: Mhm. Yeah.\nMoses Ogenrwot: They have to follow what they really want not by what other people just say that you do this. if someone say that you have to do this first thing sit down think through analyze it clearly and see that is it going to be the right thing for me to do or am I just going to do it because someone said So they have to know what to do. yeah and one thing is they should be seeking guidance probably if they aspire to pursue a given career.\nCollins Otieno: Mhm. Yes.\nMoses Ogenrwot: So they need to seek guidance from people who are already in that field. It may help them to make the right decision for the career path they want to pursue. Yeah.\nCollins Otieno: All right.\nCollins Otieno: Thank you so much, Moses. We've just come to the end of these all and I really appreciate the time you've taken to help me respond to the questions and your responses are actually going to be of great help for the purposes of this research.\nCollins Otieno: So, Moses have a wonderful time ahead and see you.\nMoses Ogenrwot: I see you.\nMoses Ogenrwot: You. Yeah.\nCollins Otieno: All right.\nMeeting ended after 00:22:29 👋\nThis editable transcript was computer generated and might contain errors. People can also change the text after it was created.\n"

Nikita.\n00:01:03 Nikita\nCurrently, I just finished my form for studies, so I'm yet to join university.\n00:01:12 Nikita\nI guess that's it.\n00:01:14 Collins\nYeah, that's really.\n00:01:17 Collins\nGood to hear.\n00:01:18 Collins\nCould you share what program of code of study you'd like to pursue when you're in college or university?\n00:01:29 Nikita\nActually, I was planning to take two courses but majorly I was planning on having law taking law as a course.\n00:01:38 Collins\nOK.\n00:01:41 Collins\nThat's interesting.\n00:01:42 Collins\nCould you tell me about exclusive institutions that you've attended before?\n00:01:49 Collins\nYeah, and how they've influenced your current educational path?\n00:01:59 Nikita\nI went to a primary.\n00:02:01 Nikita\nWas.\n00:02:01 Nikita\nAnd then I joined Mia girls.\n00:02:04 Collins\nOK.\n00:02:05 Nikita\nThat's where I took my form for studies and from the institution. I must say that they really helped me a lot.\n00:02:16 Nikita\nThey've inspired me a lot in terms of leadership and.\n00:02:20 Nikita\nYeah, my.\n00:02:21 Nikita\nI must say that the school has really played a big role in.\n00:02:25 Collins\nOK.\n00:02:27 Collins\nInteresting.\n00:02:29 Nikita\nBuilding my confidence.\n00:02:30 Collins\nHuh.\n00:02:31 Collins\nOK, that that's so interesting.\n00:02:33 Collins\nNow let's talk about your future. Basically, on your career aspirations.\n00:02:40 Collins\nWhat are your long-term career goals or the kind of work that you envision yourself doing after graduation from campus?\n00:02:53 Nikita\nActually, after graduating.\n00:02:55 Nikita\nUh huh, I was.\n00:02:58 Nikita\nMaybe join a law firm.\n00:03:00 Collins\nOK.\n00:03:03 Nikita\nYeah, if possible. Let's see.\n00:03:06 Collins\nOh, OK.\n00:03:08 Collins\nAnd do you have any short-term goals or steps that you're working on towards the desired career?\n00:03:17 Nikita\nNot really 'cause right now.\n00:03:20 Nikita\nActually, right now I'm working with this catar group, but I might say that it's not related to my course.\n00:03:28 Nikita\nYeah, that's what I'm working on right now.\n00:03:31 Collins\nSo what does it do?\n00:03:35 Nikita\nIt majorly like.\n00:03:38 Nikita\nThey said books in schools, so we have just to go through the set books, then we play.\n00:03:44 Nikita\nWe do it as a.\n00:03:45 Nikita\nAnd present it in front of students.\n00:03:46 Collins\nOh, OK. Interesting.\n00:03:48 Collins\nYeah.\n00:03:49 Collins\nOK, back to your career now, have you?\n00:03:52 Collins\nHave these goals changed over time, or have you always been focused on this?\n00:03:59 Nikita\nEver since I started looking out on my career, law has always been the number one goal.\n00:04:06 Nikita\nHas never changed ever since.\n00:04:09 Collins\nOK.\n00:04:10 Nikita\nIt doesn't work.\n00:04:11 Collins\nYeah, that's so.\n00:04:13 Collins\nAnd now I'd like to understand the reasons behind.\n00:04:17 Collins\nLaw, the reasons, actually the motivations and the influences behind your career choice.\n00:04:23 Collins\nWhat really inspired you to choose?\n00:04:26 Collins\nYour current field, which is law, was it a passion?\n00:04:31 Collins\nA specific experience or just a factor?\n00:04:35 Nikita\nActually, it was a.\n00:04:37 Nikita\nBut then I was mentally inspired by a relative.\n00:04:42 Collins\nOK.\n00:04:44 Nikita\nYeah, who's a lawyer?\n00:04:44 Nikita\nA retired.\n00:04:46 Nikita\nLet me say a retired.\n00:04:47 Nikita\nSo I got inspired and he was also inspiring me and telling me more about law.\n00:04:54 Nikita\nI just found myself loving and wanted to.\n00:04:56 Nikita\nThe call.\n00:04:58 Collins\nInteresting, you mentioned something that was leading me to my second question, which is if there are people in your life, maybe family, friends, or mentors who have worked in a similar field. And I'm just glad that you mentioned you have one of your relatives who is retired.\n00:05:17 Collins\nSo.\n00:05:19 Collins\nWould you say that this person influenced your decision into law?\n00:05:26 Nikita\nNot really 'cause. I always wanted to take law, so I won't say that the person influenced me. But on the major scale, he really helped me in standing firm and not taking turns on going to other courses.\n00:05:40 Nikita\nI must say that.\n00:05:41 Nikita\nPart did not. Well.\n00:05:48 Collins\nOh, interesting. Well.\n00:05:56 Collins\nI'm wondering if you've encountered any role models or stories that have shaped your aspirations in this space.\n00:05:56 Nikita\nYeah, yeah.\n00:05:56 Nikita\nActually, most of the illuminates from my former school, that is near.\n00:06:03 Nikita\nI've got to their studies, and I must say, yeah, they've inspired.\n00:06:07 Nikita\nAlso inspired me, like for instance Margaret.\n00:06:10 Collins\nUh.\n00:06:11 Nikita\nListen, I learned from our school, and she’s a renowned advocate of the High Court.\n00:06:17 Collins\nOK.\n00:06:17 Nikita\nShe’s really helped me.\n00:06:20 Collins\nOh. Oh, nice, nice to hear.\n00:06:23 Collins\nOK. So Nikita, I'm wondering if there are sources of information that have helped you to make decisions around your career choice.\n00:06:31 Collins\nExample, maybe relying on guidance from your school counselors or the Internet, or just other sources.\n00:06:40 Nikita\nAs well as this office, the career.\n00:06:44 Nikita\nSo I used to visit the Careers Office, and the representative always helped me and used to show me like this.\n00:06:47 Nikita\nCareer.\n00:06:52 Nikita\nThat take law as a course and.\n00:06:56 Nikita\nWhat it.\n00:06:57 Nikita\nWhat it takes me to get to that part of taking?\n\n00:07:02 Nikita\nSo I must say that the career representative, Mr. Onesie, from our school has also helped me in this.\n00:07:10 Collins\nOh, OK, OK.\n00:07:11 Collins\nDown to my—on to my final question.\n00:07:15 Collins\nUh.\n00:07:15 Collins\nDid you face any challenges or uncertainties when making these decisions?\n00:07:22 Nikita\nOf course, yes, of course. Yes. You know, at first...\n00:07:25 Nikita\nUh.\n00:07:26 Nikita\nLike during high school, I wanted to take other subjects. So while you were taking this talk on which subjects to take for you to take this specific course, I was sort of confused. And then...\n00:07:37 Nikita\nI used—people used to tell me that there are cluster points that, you know, you need to get to so that you have to take a specific course. I used to, you know, have doubts on whether I can still make it to, you know, take law as...\n00:07:51 Nikita\nCourse.\n00:07:52 Collins\nUh.\n00:07:52 Nikita\nAnd people used to talk.\n00:07:53 Nikita\nThey were like, you...\n00:07:54 Nikita\nYou know, when you join high school...\n00:07:56 Nikita\nThey're like you want to take this as a course, but when you continue, you keep on changing your mindset.\n00:08:02 Nikita\nIt used to drive away my attention from law, but then...\n00:08:06 Nikita\nYeah, I’m...\n00:08:07 Nikita\nI still don’t take law, of course.\n00:08:09 Collins\nOh, OK, OK. So...\n00:08:12 Collins\nHow did you overcome the challenges that you mentioned, like people training about your classes every other week?\n00:08:20 Nikita\nLike I said, from the mentors from my school, like the career representative, and I had to, you know, have a chat with my relative, the retired lawyer that I told you about.\n00:08:32 Nikita\nSo it really helped me a lot, and confidence—confidence was also part.\n00:08:38 Nikita\nTold you I’m not here.\n00:08:39 Collins\nOh, OK, I see. I see.\n00:08:42 Collins\nThank you so much, Nikita, for sharing your insights. They are really valuable for the purposes of this research.\n00:08:52 Collins\nI'm wondering if there's anything else you'd like to share about your career choices or motivations that we haven't covered.\n00:09:01 Nikita\nLet’s see it.\n00:09:03 Collins\nOK.\n00:09:05 Collins\nThen we have come to the end of the session, and I really appreciate the time that you've taken to be here.\n00:09:11 Collins\nI really appreciate the insights...\n00:09:14 Collins\nThat you shared. So I'll just go.\n00:09:15 Nikita\nRight.\n\n"

Thank you for participating in this research study about career choices among young people in Kenya. So, I'll be asking you some questions about your career plans and how you came to make these decisions. So there are no right or wrong answers because we are actually interested in your personal experiences.\nCollins Otieno: So this conversation will be recorded for research purposes and I'd like to know if you have any questions before we begin.\nOchieng Okoth: No, I have no questions.\nOchieng Okoth: Let's just kick in.\nCollins Otieno: Thanks. So let me just get straight into your background information.\nCollins Otieno: Could you tell me a bit about yourself and what you currently doing? Mhm. Yeah.\nOchieng Okoth: Okay, I am Henry and…\nOchieng Okoth: for the recent past it has been a struggle from Kitamo but for the recent past I have known what I am and what I want to be my aspirations and what I dedicate myself to. in high school I was the chairman to journalism club and I was the spokesperson for the debate club and those two clubs if you're keen with them then you'll notice it's more about the me being vocal speaking I have been in public speaking spaces I have participated in public speaking events while still in high school there was one I did when I was in form three and I\nOchieng Okoth: I went to national level but I fell short. I was number three. I was position four actually but I participated in the public speaking events. last year in form four I did a ton of debates. we were Nairobi the edge conference to be precise in August holiday and…\nCollins Otieno: Okay.\nOchieng Okoth: we secured our spot there due to the toughness that we had. So all this just proves that I am a person I love using words and I have been a leader. For me to have been the chairperson to the journalism club and a spokesman to the debate club, it means I have some character in me.\nCollins Otieno: Yeah. True.\nOchieng Okoth: So choose to take a path that leads me to the leadership and exposure…\nOchieng Okoth: because number one thing I understand about leadership is that you need to be diverse. You need to understand You need how you can guide other people when you're leading them. And for you to get this it only comes from exposure. Yeah.\nCollins Otieno: Yeah, that's a very comprehensive introduction Henry and…\nCollins Otieno: I'm interested in knowing what level of education you completed so far. Mhm. Okay.\nOchieng Okoth: I was in Kanga High School just situated at Rango constituency.\nOchieng Okoth: That's why I did my form one to form four level education and I finished form four at last year 2024.\nCollins Otieno: Interesting.\nOchieng Okoth: Yeah. Currently I am pursuing a short course at the KCA University computer here in Kisumu branch.\nCollins Otieno: Interesting. what kind of work do you envision yourself doing in the future? Yes.\nOchieng Okoth: what kind of work I envision myself doing in the future. I'm a person who I am diverse in what I plan to do. I'm an entrepr I have the mindset entrepreneur.  I'm thinking of starting a couple of businesses or joining couple of businesses and in that basically after that I just side couple with it I couple it with me being a leader. I want to be a leader. I want to be I want to be a leader and I want to be an entrepreneur. Those are two things that I've been king. Yeah.\nOchieng Okoth: Those are the two things I think I will that's where my dreams are aligned.\nCollins Otieno: Interesting. I see. And as much as you're thinking about being an entrepreneur, you may want to specialize in a specific field or direction of a career path. would you want to talk about that?\nOchieng Okoth: I haven't understood your question.\nCollins Otieno: As much as you're going to specialize in entrepreneurship, an entrepreneur can be a doctor with an entrepreneurial mindset. We can have a teacher with an entrepreneurial mindset. We can have an engineer with an entrepreneurial mindset. would you like to talk more about the specific path that you're going to pick or that you're thinking about picking? Okay.\n00:05:00\nOchieng Okoth: And once I'm done with law, I may go for journalism.\nOchieng Okoth: I may but I want to pursue law. So I want to be a lawyer. And I will use that I may have a law firm or I might join law firm.\nCollins Otieno: Yeah. Mhm.\nOchieng Okoth: I want to also do the course, certified public accountancy course that also equipped me with the knowledge on how to deal with money, how to move money, how to maintain the flow of money and all that. Just basically accountancy.  So how I will package my response when I started thinking about my career path.\nCollins Otieno: Interesting. when did you first start thinking about these career path? Mhm.\nOchieng Okoth: I just mentioned at the beginning of the call just quite recently I joined high school before I knew all about this and when I joined high school I want to give special thanks to the high school I went to Kanga school very good school equipped me with the skills I joined the club and…\nCollins Otieno: Mhm.\nOchieng Okoth: that was where lots of people I received lots of compliments and lots of congratulations for how I did my presentation of news and it's funny because I wasn't the only one who was doing it but when people and told me that there are many people who were doing journalism but yours is special you have to look at what you're doing so that gave me the thought wow so people can see this in me let me see what I think of it and it's just settled in my mind and that's how I came to choose my path and by joining the debate club I have become a very competitive debater. I can debate day pretty much the whole day. And that's why I want to also go for law.\nOchieng Okoth: Love I did history in high school and…\nCollins Otieno: Mhm. …\nOchieng Okoth: yeah I did well in my history exams and I believe that it is good the law I have a cousin in Kisumu she's pretty old and…\nCollins Otieno: interesting. I think law is actually a very good career path. So, Henry, how did you get to learn about these career path that you're choosing? Yes. Mhm. Okay. Mhm.\nOchieng Okoth: She has a law firm and she has a law firm. So she took me through it. I told her what I want to come and meet with you. I want us to go have a chat because I have a couple of things I want to discuss with you. And that was where I start with her and…\nCollins Otieno: Mhm. Yeah.\nOchieng Okoth: I explained to her what I don't love and I explained to her how I view myself in the next five years or so.  And from that conversation she told me law is actually the right direction to take only if you're competitive. just very you have to be competitive for you to have a spot for yourself in the field of law. Otherwise you'll just be like the other people who have done law on paper but have nothing to show it. So I believe she gave me the right direction she gave me the right advice.\nOchieng Okoth: That was where I got to want to know more about law and to indulge in law in my future aspirations sources of information say the internet I am also interested in helping other people\nCollins Otieno: Uh-huh. Mhm.\nOchieng Okoth: \nOchieng Okoth: because it was tough I found it tough for me to find my way into getting law as a career for myself and finding what exactly I wanted to do. So I feel like I have had it it is something I went through and I believe many other people are outside there and still don't know about it. There are people who believe just of financial constraints or because of their background because of their skin or because of how they speak or how they look then they do not have access to such information or such what opportunities and that is why I started joining foundations and there's one which I love most it's called the foundation and it is good its ambitions are good and…\nOchieng Okoth: they're aligned to what I want to do in the future I want to help other people start walking. I want to lead them to knowing themselves and not just helping them walk. They should walk and also bring people with them so that they know that the success is not just for a number of people. It's not confined to maybe a certain number of people. It is for the broad-based mind. If you have the drive and the tenacity to stick with your goals, then you will go for it.\n00:10:00\nCollins Otieno: Interesting.\nCollins Otieno: Interesting. I'm actually also interested in knowing…\nCollins Otieno: how you came to verify or cross check this information to ensure credibility or something of that sort. Yeah. you just mentioned things like the internet as your sources of information.\nOchieng Okoth: information on\nCollins Otieno: So I'm wondering how you came to verify to assertain that you actually getting the right information that you need.\nCollins Otieno: So how Mhm.\nOchieng Okoth: …\nOchieng Okoth: it's not really much of getting to ascertain if it's the right information. I call it I would like to base it as a common sense. If you see something is working and…\nOchieng Okoth: this is something that most people don't really look at keenly. I try looking at things on a perspective that is more broader to the normal person. If you look at something like what you want to do you have to look at it you have to see this guy is has he done this yes he has done it I love to get inspiration from Edwin Cuna the current senator for Nairobi Edina was one and…\nCollins Otieno: Mhm.\nOchieng Okoth: I was watching a podcast I was listening to a podcast of him he was saying…\nOchieng Okoth: and how law helped him broaden his network it led to him open it opened doors for him that he never imagined and it worked for him so it will silly of me to now start saying okay maybe there's something that I need for myself or I don't know how to put it he's one person learned about there are a couple of other people similar to his shoes or…\nCollins Otieno: Mhm. Yeah.\nCollins Otieno: Mhm.\nOchieng Okoth: similar in the same shoe that Edwina is in I have gotten information about them from YouTube but I have listened exactly to what they're saying so I would love put it in one hole and say I've listened to a lot of podcasts and…\nCollins Otieno: Okay. Yeah.\nOchieng Okoth: I have used my mind to say that this is working I think and I see he did this they all did the same thing and it has worked for them so why should not because I have the same drive I know myself I understand…\nOchieng Okoth: what I want and I want it so bad that I will go for it the law of Kenya …\nCollins Otieno: Interesting. I see.\nCollins Otieno: I see. So Henry, what do you know about law in Kenya? yeah. Yes. No, I mean what do you know about the career which is law in Kenya?\nOchieng Okoth: I thought you wanted me to start talking about the law of Kenya.\nCollins Otieno: Not really. Not Yes. Yeah.\nOchieng Okoth: The career of law in Kenya. Law is one of the most recently degraded courses that people are starting to talk about because to three or four people who were in the same school as me and a couple more around four other friends who are in other schools and they had their minds inclined to law previously but because of what they had from people what they've heard remember what they've heard what they've not seen they've only heard then changed their minds to other places…\nOchieng Okoth: but I'm the person who has the tenacity to stick to what I want because I believe the key to the universe granting the universe is very generous but only to those who want so bad. I believe that the law in Kenya is fit for those…\nCollins Otieno: Mhm.\nOchieng Okoth: who are aggressive those who are risk and those who are always looking for opportunities striving to look for opportunities and understanding that there are many other people who want these opportunities but they want it more. So that is…\nCollins Otieno: Yeah. Mhm.\nOchieng Okoth: how I will law and that is how I will take it and I believe that with that mindset nothing will the job market for law.\nCollins Otieno: Yeah, That is very true. And I'm loving how you're giving me the responses. So, I'm actually interested in knowing what you've learned about the job market for this career. Yes.\nOchieng Okoth: Yeah, I understand that by going by being a good lawyer, first of all you have to be somebody who's transparent to you people for you to find people who will constantly be coming for you if they have problems or referring you to other people. You have to be transparent which is about that I have learned.\nCollins Otieno: Mhm. Yeah.\nCollins Otieno: Yes. Yeah.\nOchieng Okoth: I am a person who is brutally honest. I will be honest with you when I see something is going wrong and I will be honest I see something is going right. So I have to be brutally honest with the people I deal with. I am a person who doesn't love laziness. I'm not I don't love lazy people. not I don't love that is a very strong way to put it. I do not like associating myself to lazy people because I believe in the dictim that if you flow if you have with five thieves you'll be the sixth thief. Same way if you have with five winners,…\n00:15:00\nOchieng Okoth: five lawyers,…\nCollins Otieno: Mhm. Yeah.\nOchieng Okoth: five entrepreneurs, you will be the sixth. Even if you don't want, you will be the sixth because you'll start doing things that they're doing. You'll start walking the way they're walking. You'll start doing a number of a ton of things that they're doing. So I believe that purely it truly lies on aggression number one and then transparency and then you have somebody who is willing to socialize a lot. Somebody who will listen and you keep your word. If somebody tells you something it's between me you and nothing else. So that is professionalism. It lies in the field ofism. So I believe that with those three me being equipped with those three then I am absolutely perfect for the job.\nCollins Otieno: Interesting.\nCollins Otieno: And what qualifications are I think amongst the things that you mentioned also you mentioned professionalism you've also mentioned being aggressive and I think that also matters so much in that space and so do you have any information about the typical compensation in the same  build the salary for a lawyer just a typical one. Mhm.\nOchieng Okoth: compensation as in the salary.\nOchieng Okoth: I haven't gotten to, that kind of depth of it. But I believe if you're doing a good job and you are providing the services that you have stated and…\nOchieng Okoth: you do exactly what you've told your client you'll be doing…\nCollins Otieno: Okay.\nOchieng Okoth: then salary will not be an issue. I feel like if you do the best job then you'll actually get compensations because they will give you more because you have done more than they asked for. So, I haven't really gone into the crevices of somebody I talk to.\nCollins Otieno: No problem. is this someone that you talk to about your career plans? Yes. Or I could just rephrase it as who do you talk to about your career plans?\nOchieng Okoth: Who do I talk to about my career plans? from ever since I finished high school and…\nCollins Otieno: Mhm. Yeah.\nOchieng Okoth: even before I finished high school, I have made it absolutely clear to everybody that sees me that it not very easy to access me unless you're the person who has the same goals and ambition. Not access me in talking to me but access me in having me as a friend of yours who we are in constant communication with.  I have made absolutely clear to everyone even in high school that for you to be within my circle you have to have the same ambitions. By having the same ambition does not mean we have to both want law but rather we should have if I focus on something if I put my mind to something and you also put your mind to something then we are not the kind of people who will give up along the way. That is what I mean having the same ambition. So I talk to my friends because I believe circle is a very clean one.\nOchieng Okoth: It's a circle that brings me…\nOchieng Okoth: because I have selectively chosen the people who are going to be around me and the people who were around me. So is how are the people I talk to. Apart from that I talk to my dad. I talked to there's this guy He's on Instagram and on his social media platforms is called Kelly Inspirations. I don't…\nCollins Otieno: Yeah, I know.\nOchieng Okoth: if you've heard of him. He was recently in our school and I got the opportunity to talk to him. I have also talked to some cast commissioner there's this cast commission I have talked to the cast commissioner and…\nCollins Otieno: Okay. Okay. Mhm.\nOchieng Okoth: I have been in close conversation with him I've also talked a founder of the organization he's an alumnest of my school but an organization of himself but doing quite well he's thriving and I have also been asking them all these questions.\nOchieng Okoth: How have you been doing this? And also, I'd say I've been talking to you Anona and you have also, apparel. You have helped, a lot of things. And I can't thank everyone that I talk to because I believe the kind of circle I have is one which when I have a problem, get it solved for me. Yeah.\nCollins Otieno: interesting. so I'm just interested just briefly…\nCollins Otieno: if you could briefly tell me the kind of conversations that you have with these people. You've mentioned so many people and that tells me how aggressive you are. So would you briefly just mention the kind of conversations that you have about your career?\n00:20:00\nCollins Otieno: Mhm. Yeah.\nOchieng Okoth: The normal person meets somebody who is famous, They think this guy I don't have money and he has money. So the number one thing I do is I make it absolutely clear to them that I am not talking to them because I want their money.\nOchieng Okoth: That is the number one thing I put forward because most of them shy from talking to the ordinary people because they believe when they come to them they are only coming to them for money. So I make it absolutely they do not want your money.\nCollins Otieno: Yeah. Yeah.\nOchieng Okoth: I am only interested in learning from you just from the sidelines. I do not want any financial benefits but I just want you to listen to me and I want to also listen to you so that you see what I have and that I'm a person who if you trust and if people…\nOchieng Okoth: who move forward they have broadened my perspective that for you to be doing something you must have the innate drive you must have something you drive you're pushing forward you cannot just wake up every morning and…\nCollins Otieno: Interesting.\nCollins Otieno: How have these conversations actually influenced your thinking? Mhm. Yeah.\nOchieng Okoth: sume calories consume water consume food you sleep you drink you cannot just live your life cluelessly there's a reason why God put there's a reason why your parents put you on earth and there's a reason why they invested in you so you must have the mindset you must have goals I learned to note down my goals that is number one I learned to put them down and work closer and closer to my goals and I am sure that this is me when I'm 18 years I believe years from now I will be somewhere and I believe I will be somewhere doing something because if I continue sticking to my goals and putting God forward because he is the creator and he's the one who has given me all this it will be shameful of me not to give him his glory and…\nCollins Otieno: Yeah. Mhm.\nOchieng Okoth: thank him for what he has done then he will take away all these. So it has put my goals down. It has taught me to give myself peace. I do exercises a lot. I am now maintaining my health because these people also tell me in as much as you focusing on your goals, you should also your health.\nCollins Otieno: Mhm. Yeah.\nOchieng Okoth: There's no way you can be killing it out there and you're doing all this but your health is on the decline. There's no way you will live to see the fruits of your success in the future. So my health is a priority that I put to myself. I am watchful on the things I eat. I am also watchful people I talk to because they are the direct link to they know me. The people I dispose certain informations to I am very keen because I know if they decide to come against me with this information they'll have put me down. So I am very on what I am giving out to people as I have said noting down my goals and…\nOchieng Okoth: keeping my health fit. But I am still learning. I am not closed my mind not to learn. So we live and I believe that as I continue learning there are many more that I will learn as I grow.\nCollins Otieno: Interesting.\nCollins Otieno: I really wish you in your current and future endeavors. Henry, almost to my last questions. what role, if any, has your family played in your career planning?\nOchieng Okoth: my family,…\nOchieng Okoth: my dad has been very supportive of me and he shows the support every day when he calls me. I was on the call with him today. I received …\nCollins Otieno: Mhm. Yeah.\nOchieng Okoth: I had sent an application letter to Yale model African Union for requesting for a response back and it was really good. I told my dad, first person I informed and he was very happy. He called me later, congratulated me. Yesterday I also received another email from model United Nations where I had also placed another application there and I received it was to my glad gladness I was because the news came back good and I have considered as a junior chair for one of their summit that is coming this year here in Nairobi.  So I am going to sit there as a junior chair for the first time. I have never encountered you model United Nations the first time and my dad has been an inspiration to all that because he pushes me.\nOchieng Okoth: He tells me you're more than what you think and he tells me even when I have done that he gives me the sense of looking for more and finding more because he believes that if I start celebrating the wins I have made then my mind will lose track of what I actually want to go for. So my mom also and…\n00:25:00\nOchieng Okoth: my dad but my dad the upper hand he has played an upper hand and my brother and my friends Okay.\nCollins Otieno: Wow, congratulations on the wins and…\nCollins Otieno: everything. I wish you how have your educational experiences shaped your career interests? I heard you mention your educational experiences. How have they shaped your career interests? Mhm. Okay.\nOchieng Okoth: As I've said I was in Kanga High School. I was in love with the subject history and I was in love with the subject English. I was love with geography as well and a bit of biology. Yeah, I love how the world works. I am a person…\nOchieng Okoth: who seeing how everything works and physics. I forgot to mention physics. So when I was reading and…\nCollins Otieno: Okay. Mhm.\nOchieng Okoth: when I was learning in high school, we had a smartboard in the library for the school. We used to go there and learn on, geography. Maybe we going to see the beef ranching in Argentina and all that. I was,…\nCollins Otieno: Yeah. Mhm.\nOchieng Okoth: I was love with the technology they had and I was looking at Kenya and I was saying, \"Wow, Kenya is so laid off. It's very behind in terms of technology and it's very behind in terms of efficient I will not a lie to everyone right now that the efficiency of the government right now is not very good it's not as it speak and I got my drive from there I had the desire to help my country and help myself grow help the people I love and that's I want to do entrepreneurship I want to get into these spaces and…\nOchieng Okoth: have something going on for myself. Yes. Absolutely.\nCollins Otieno: Interesting.\nCollins Otieno: Are there any challenges that you are anticipating while going to pursue this career of law?\nOchieng Okoth: If there are no challenges, then I would have been the president of the world.\nCollins Otieno: Yeah. True.\nOchieng Okoth: There must be challenges.\nCollins Otieno: Mhm. Yeah.\nOchieng Okoth: And these are what keep you up and running. The challenges leave to tell you that you have not yet made it. You are not the only person who wants this thing. You're not the only one who deserves to get it. There are many other people out there who deserve to get it. So, it just challenges me to, become the best every day. Every day I just work towards becoming the best and the best because I tell myself there's somebody else somewhere in the world who has the same aspirations as you and he's working harder than you. So, when I think of that,…\nOchieng Okoth: I knock off vation. There's something that kills a lot of I lack motivation to do this. People say if you lack motivation to do something then just remain where you are. Don't even dream far. Just as…\nCollins Otieno: Yeah. Mhm.\nOchieng Okoth: if anything you just think of having your daily bread because as long as you have food every day then You will not die. You're guaranteed of life. But if you have a mindset to think of I want more than just food and clothing and shelter then you must be who also does more because there are people…\nCollins Otieno: Yeah. Mhm.\nOchieng Okoth: who work so hard for whatever they have at the top and they're not willing to let go of what they have. So you have to fight your way to the top especially if you're coming from a background that does not allow you to get into such but I'm lucky not to have come from a very bad background. I believe the small support I get from my family will help me propel my way to the top resources resources support okay support I don't really incline on getting\nCollins Otieno: What resources or support do you think will be helpful for you in pursuing your career or support? Yeah.\nOchieng Okoth: What if…\nOchieng Okoth: what drives me to my goals is the hate and the mockery when people look at you and say you're dreaming too far that is what drives me if I put my mind to thinking I want support then it will because if right my support comes from my dad and my mom if they die then my will have died if I incline my mind to thinking my support only comes to mom and dad or…\nCollins Otieno: Mhm.\nCollins Otieno: Yeah. Mhm.\nOchieng Okoth: my friends they may leave me you never know you don't know what tomorrow promises. So if I only incline my mind to thinking about the support these people are giving me then once they are not there then I'll soon die and not dying but my goals and my dreams will die.  I only want to have a circle of people because it to the top alone is very difficult especially current world we have where you are linked with a lot of things somebody can see something that you didn't see and tell you by the way I know a person who can do this and then they call you and then they tell you there's this and this and that and you're happy because this is a friend of yours who has linked you with something that you didn't know and you are also a person who links them with things so I\n00:30:00\nOchieng Okoth: Purely I work so much on maintaining my circle and making sure my circle is of winners and people who are of the same ambitions as I am.\nOchieng Okoth: So I believe that is the only I need.\nCollins Otieno: Okay.\nOchieng Okoth: I won't talk of money. I won't talk of what is there anything else aside from money that rules the world current? I think it's just money. I won't talk of money because I believe if I don't have I don't know how that money came then there's one thing I tell myself the faster the money comes to you then the faster it will leave you if you receive lot of money once…\nCollins Otieno: Yeah. Yes.\nOchieng Okoth: then the huge lot of money will go away immediately but if you receive it for you you've worked so hard to have it then it will be very difficult for you to lose that money because exactly what worth it is and that's why I want to work for the money that I will need in the future and that is how I believe I will maintain myself to having that kind of wealth and…\nOchieng Okoth: pass it down to generation. Yeah. the job market is screwed.\nCollins Otieno: Interesting.\nCollins Otieno: Is there anything that you'd like to share that we haven't mentioned here? Anything else around your career choice?\nOchieng Okoth: That is what I would want to say. The job market is screwed.\nOchieng Okoth: And to be…\nCollins Otieno: Mhm.\nOchieng Okoth: if you should be smart. I believe that if the job market is crude especially here in Kenya and in Africa to be more broad if you understand that the job market is screwed you don't just sit there and just leave your life normally and continue thinking the same way you are thinking if change comes then you must also be willing to change from your head if you see change in the environment then you must also change in your head if you see this has happened and you're not used to it happening must also change\nOchieng Okoth: the way you think and view things. So if I see the job market is screwed, I must change the way I've been acting. I must now be aggressive. I not only focus on my books, I must also focus on, how I will live after I get my books and after I get certificates. There are many people outside here who have degrees and certificates. But they have nothing to show of it because they only focus on this and it did not work for them. it was designed to work for you.\nOchieng Okoth: It was designed that you just study and job will come automatically. that is how as long as you have a degree you'll get a job but time it got screwed and now you have to change the way you think. So you have to change how you have to be more aggressive. You have to be more compelled. You must have the burning passion to go for what you want because it will not come for you easy. Yeah.\nCollins Otieno: Yeah. …\nCollins Otieno: I Thank you for that. So, finally Henry, we've actually exceeded the time that you are that I mentioned to you, but I'm so happy that you have responded so well to the questions that I've been asking.\nCollins Otieno: So as we conclude is there any advice that you'd give to other young people who are making career decisions.\nOchieng Okoth: be smart.\nOchieng Okoth: That's the baseline. You just have to be smart. You have to understand how the world works. You have to understand how people around you are. You must be smart with everything that is say just be smart.\nCollins Otieno: All So, we're just coming to the end of our short survey. I'd still say short and I want to appreciate you for the time that you've taken to listen to me and give good responses to the questions. Your responses are going to be very helpful for the purposes of this research and I appreciate.\nOchieng Okoth: Thank you very much.\nCollins Otieno: All right, you have a nice time. All right. Thanks.\nMeeting ended after 00:34:52 👋\nThis editable transcript was computer generated and might contain errors. People can also change the text after it was created.\n"

I go by the name Marilla Pius. Currently, I’m in my second year at the University of Nairobi, taking a Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery.\n00:01:12 Pius\nAnd...\n00:01:14 Pius\nAs far as the course is concerned...\n00:01:17 Pius\nEverything is now going on very well.\n00:01:19 Pius\nI haven’t seen any problem, so maybe you can shoot up your questions so I can answer them.\n00:01:27 Collins\nAll right, all...\n00:01:28 Pius\nYeah.\n00:01:28 Collins\nThank you for that introduction, Pius.\n00:01:30 Collins\nNow I’ve already learned about your current career path, and I’m just interested in knowing...\n00:01:40 Collins\nMaybe the schools or institutions you attended before joining the University of Nairobi and how these institutions have influenced your current educational path.\n00:01:52 Pius\nOK, to start with...\n00:01:55 Pius\nI did my 8-4-4.\n00:01:58 Pius\nThe first eight was in a public primary school called Chunge.\n00:02:07 Pius\nIt’s located in Migori County in the Uriri constituency.\n00:02:10 Pius\nThat school...\n00:02:13 Pius\nIs a really good school.\n00:02:14 Pius\nIt shaped my future in that it enabled me to get the marks required to advance to high school.\n00:02:19 Pius\nIn that school, I managed to score 404 marks, and by doing that, I was called to Kanga School, where I completed my high school education.\n00:02:36 Pius\nAt the end of the four years...\n00:02:39 Pius\nI emerged victorious, as I know myself.\n00:02:45 Pius\nI got a mean grade of an A plain with 82 points.\n00:02:53 Pius\nSince my dream was always to become a doctor...\n00:02:57 Pius\nI applied for the course of Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery at the University of Nairobi as my first choice and Kenyatta University as my second choice.\n00:03:08 Pius\nAnd by good chance...\n00:03:09 Pius\nAs I expected, I was called to the University of Nairobi, where I’m currently taking my desired course, Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery.\n00:03:19 Pius\nAnd soon after, I’m expected to become a good doctor in this country.\n00:03:25 Collins\nWow, yeah, that’s great to hear, Pius, because...\n00:03:33 Collins\nI think you’re a very bright individual. If you talk about getting 404 marks in your primary education and then...\n00:03:40 Collins\nProceeding to get a clean A plain with 82 points out of a possible 84...\n00:03:47 Collins\nThat definitely means that you can and will be a really great doctor.\n00:03:54 Collins\nSo let’s talk about your future, Pius. I’m interested in knowing your long-term career goals or the kind of work you envision yourself doing after graduating from the University of Nairobi.\n00:04:11 Pius\nAs for now...\n00:04:14 Pius\nMy goal is, currently I’m pursuing general medicine and surgery.\n00:04:24 Pius\nI’m looking forward to opening up some clinics in my area because, back in Migori, near Awendo, there’s insufficient healthcare.\n00:04:39 Pius\nSo upon completing my course, I’m looking forward to opening such an organization...\n00:04:53 Pius\nWhere services will be offered at a relatively low cost to cater to the low-income population.\n00:05:03 Collins\nWow, that’s so great! Is there anything you’re doing, maybe like a short-term goal or any steps that you’re working on, to move you towards your desired long-term career goal?\n00:05:17 Pius\nYeah, currently I’m taking my studies seriously because I need to prove that I can become a doctor first.\n00:05:25 Collins\nYes, yes.\n00:05:30 Pius\nSecondly...\n00:05:33 Pius\nI’m building my network.\n00:05:36 Collins\nYes.\n00:05:36 Pius\nSo I’m trying to connect with influential people in the country...\n00:05:42 Pius\nWho can impart wisdom and guidance.\n00:05:46 Collins\nYeah.\n00:05:49 Pius\nBecause achieving such a goal is a great task.\n00:05:53 Collins\nYes, yes.\n00:05:54 Pius\nYeah, that’s it.\n00:05:56 Collins\nWow, that’s so great to hear. If you’re looking for more networks, then I’m also here to help.\n00:06:03 Collins You may want to include me among the great people that you know.\n00:06:08 Collins Anyway, I'll move to the other question, which is if.\n00:06:13 Pius Yeah. Excuse me before we proceed.\n00:06:14 Pius It holds.\n00:06:17 Pius No. You are one of the young people. Know that you.\n00:06:21 Pius You are our President during high school.\n00:06:23 Pius Dania.\n00:06:24 Pius Mm.\n00:06:25 Pius And we expect you to become one of the good leaders back then, kama game.\n00:06:30 Collins Yeah.\n00:06:30 Collins Definitely. That's going to pass probably in 2020.\n00:06:35 Collins So we may want to talk about that briefly after this. So let me just get to the third question.\n00:06:36 Pius They are hopeful.\n00:06:46 Collins Which is.\n00:06:47 Collins If your goals have changed over time, or you've always been focused on this path.\n00:06:54 Collins This medical path that you're talking about.\n00:06:57 Pius To be honest.\n00:07:00 Pius When I was taking my primary education, I always wanted to be a pilot. But.\n00:07:06 Pius Because I.\n00:07:07 Pius I was wondering how those airplanes fly over such altitudes.\n00:07:14 Pius But as I proceeded to higher learning institutions like high school, my goals changed, and now my eyes are focused on the medical field.\n00:07:27 Pius OK.\n00:07:28 Pius Yeah, that sounds.\n00:07:29 Collins All right.\n00:07:31 Collins Now I'd like to understand the reasons behind your career choice. Actually, the reasons why you decided to pick medicine. You previously talked about wanting to be a pilot, and then suddenly things changed, and now you're into the medical field. I'm really interested in knowing your motivations and influences.\n00:07:54 Collins So what really inspired you to choose your current field of study or career path? Is it passion, a specific experience, or other factors?\n00:08:06 Pius One thing I know is that I realized my passion. I was super passionate about learning in this medical field.\n00:08:24 Collins OK.\n00:08:25 Pius That's why I decided to shift to this path.\n00:08:28 Collins OK, OK. And are there people in your life such as your family, friends, or mentors who have worked in a similar field before?\n00:08:39 Pius Not yet, but I'm categorically hoping to be the first so that I can inspire young people behind me.\n00:08:45 Collins OK.\n00:08:46 Collins All right, all right.\n00:08:49 Collins Have you ever experienced any role models or stories that may have shaped your aspirations in this space?\n00:08:57 Pius Yeah, yeah. This doctor.\n00:09:01 Pius This surgeon called.\n00:09:04 Pius This popular one.\n00:09:06 Collins Ben Carson or who?\n00:09:07 Pius Ben Carson, of course. That's my role model.\n00:09:11 Collins OK.\n00:09:13 Collins So.\n00:09:15 Collins He really inspired you?\n00:09:17 Pius Yeah, alright.\n00:09:20 Collins I'm interested in knowing the sources of information that have helped you make decisions around your career choice.\n00:09:27 Collins For instance, did you rely on guidance from school counsellors, your family, the Internet, or other sources?\n00:09:39 Pius OK, concerning my career, I was guided by books. I read about Ben Carson in his book.\n00:09:52 Pius The Internet is also all over. So that's the second thing.\n00:09:56 Collins OK.\n00:09:57 Collins Wow. Wow. Wow, wow.\n00:10:00 Collins So how are you using the Internet? Just to get articles, pieces of articles, or maybe videos? You know, there are many videos on YouTube.\n00:10:12 Pius Yeah, you know.\n00:10:15 Pius On the Internet, you get some articles like \"this doctor invented this,\" \"managed to do this.\" That inspired me.\n00:10:22 Collins Wow. Wow. Wow.\n00:10:23 Collins So, Pius, I'm also interested in knowing how you are making your decisions. In the process of making your decisions, especially picking this career as a choice, you might have considered other fields like electrical engineering or architecture. Did you face any challenges or uncertainties when picking your current field? If so, how did you overcome them?\n00:11:11 Pius The first thing is, I didn't face any challenges picking my career. As long as you're passionate about something, you shouldn't be undecided. I was so sure of what I wanted, and that's when I landed in this course.\n00:11:28 Collins OK.\n00:11:29 Collins Well, that must be so interesting. We've just come to the end of the interview, as I mentioned earlier. I really appreciate your time. Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts. Your insights are very valuable to our research.\n00:11:51 Collins You have a wonderful day.\n\n"

The session should take approximately 10 minutes, and I'll be asking you some questions about your studies, career goals, and the motivations behind your choices.\n00:00:40 Collins\nJust feel free to answer as openly as you're comfortable with. Does that sound good?\n00:00:49 Collins\nDoes that sound good?\n00:00:56 Rawlings\nYes, it sounds.\n00:00:57 Rawlings\nI had a problem unmuting my audio.\n00:01:00 Collins\nNo worries.\n00:01:00 Collins\nSo let's start with a little introduction about yourself.\n00:01:05 Rawlings\nSo basically, I'm Rawlings, a 2.1 student pursuing Communication and Information Engineering at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology.\n00:01:18 Collins\nOK, good.\n00:01:20 Rawlings\nIt's fascinating, the technology field, so how it's growing at a rapid pace in Africa.\n00:01:30 Collins\nOK. Uh-huh. Thank you for sharing your introduction, Rawlings. Now, can you share what program—oh, you've actually mentioned that. I’m wondering if you could tell me about the schools or institutions that you've attended before college and how they've influenced your current educational path?\n00:01:53 Rawlings\nSo I began my studies at an academy when I studied nursery. Thereafter, I was taken to a public primary school because my parents believed that private students are spoon-fed, whether it's true or not.\n00:02:08 Rawlings\nI attended the very young primary, a public institution, Sumo Central. Thereafter, I got to join Kanga High School.\n00:02:21 Rawlings\nBut due to reasons of disagreement between the administration and my father, which are personal from way back, I got transferred to Maseno School.\n00:02:35 Rawlings\nYeah, thereafter, I did my KCSE. I scored an A-minus.\n00:02:41 Rawlings\nBecause of these national schools, good academic institutions, I ended up joining JKUAT to pursue engineering.\n00:02:49 Collins\nOK.\n00:02:51 Collins\nOK, I see.\n00:02:52 Collins\nThank you for sharing about your institutions and how that has influenced you.\n00:03:00 Collins\nI'm wondering if you may want to talk about your long-term career goals or the kind of work that you envision yourself doing after graduation.\n00:03:12 Rawlings\nSo after I complete my five-year course, I'd want to run a hotspot management solution.\n00:03:17 Collins\nUh-huh.\n00:03:18 Rawlings\nIt's a design that can be used to simplify ISP operations by automating virtual management. Because the field of telecommunication within Africa, so to say, hasn't developed as much because we are using boosters and receivers, unlike developed countries like China and Japan, where they're using satellites.\n00:03:37 Rawlings\nBut at the end of it all, because it's big corporations that run the telecommunication industry, there'll come a time when telecommunication will need a hotspot management solution that carries out the billing services. The ISP can be international, but the billing services, obviously, at the end of the day, need to be a locally engineered or rather my niche system.\n00:04:14 Rawlings\nSo that's my goal. I believe it's going to be a lucrative venture.\n00:04:19 Collins\nYeah, that's really great to hear. And yeah, it really is a good one.\n00:04:25 Collins\nNow, do you have any short-term goals or steps that you're working on to move you towards these desired careers?\n00:04:35 Rawlings\nCurrently, I'm being mentored by an engineer who was a graduate from JKUAT.\n00:04:40 Rawlings\nHe pursued his master's in China and is currently running an ISP provider in Athi River called The Next Thing Networks. He's the one who actually told me about this venture.\n00:04:59 Rawlings\nBecause basically, he is not going to be with putting the cables and everything. So during my free time, or at the weekends, I take my time, go to Athi River, and get to learn a few things about it, like how the infrastructure works and what Africa needs to improve on.\n00:05:20 Rawlings\nThere's no essence in us using different cable lines for different telecommunication companies. We can just combine them into one.\n00:05:33 Rawlings\nSo basically, that's what I'm doing right now, just making myself conversant with the entire engineering field.\n00:05:40 Collins\nOK, OK.\n00:05:41 Collins\nI'm wondering if these goals of yours have changed over time, or if these are the same goals that you've always been focused on.\n00:05:55 Rawlings\nFrom primary or?\n00:05:58 Collins\nLike before you joined campus, you know there must have been that contemplation between...\n\n\n00:06:05 Collins\nThese really the best course for me to go for, or should I settle for these other?\n00:06:10 Collins\nYeah. So I'm wondering if this is something that you've had in your mind even before you joined campus or?\n00:06:18 Collins\nAt some point you wanted to divert from that.\n00:06:24 Rawlings\nSincerely speaking, I only came to know about the coastal communication engineering last year.\n00:06:30 Rawlings\nJune, when we're doing our coast election.\n00:06:32 Rawlings\nI.\n00:06:33 Rawlings\nI knew.\n00:06:34 Rawlings\nI knew what telecommunication meant.\n00:06:35 Rawlings\nIn, but I never.\n00:06:36 Rawlings\nIt's a field that one can pursue. Want a graduate?\n00:06:40 Rawlings\nSo listen, my goals were different.\n00:06:45 Rawlings\nI was interested in international relations, political science, whatnot, that would be to be precise, but because this is Africa, partial obviously doesn't.\n00:06:57 Rawlings\nGo hand in hand with the opportunity.\n00:06:59 Rawlings\nSo I hope it for an for an engineering course that I feel would appease my conscience and I'll find interesting.\n00:07:00 Collins\nUh.\n00:07:08 Rawlings\nThat's how I settled on telecommunication.\n00:07:10 Collins\nOK, OK. And you've actually mentioned something that is very interesting about.\n00:07:16 Collins\nPassion and that was leading me to wanting to know the reasons behind your career choices.\n00:07:23 Collins\nWhat really inspired you to choose your current field?\n00:07:26 Collins\nBecause you mentioned not really partial and what not.\n00:07:30 Collins\nCould you talk about?\n00:07:32 Collins\nWas it really a passion? Just.\n00:07:34 Collins\nA specific experience or other factors.\n00:07:41 Rawlings\nSo growing up as a child, I used to watch a lot of sitcom and from the sitcom I used to see inventions from.\n00:07:51 Rawlings\nThe Hollywood the top tech guys.\n00:07:53 Rawlings\nSo I had an interest in technology back in the day, but it kind of wiped away as I approached high school and through high school.\n00:08:04 Rawlings\nThat's how I grew interested in international relations and political science. So.\n00:08:09 Rawlings\nWhen the.\n00:08:10 Rawlings\nA university selection came.\n00:08:12 Rawlings\nObviously it's not going to be a one man affair being the first one. Obviously the parents will have interest in which course I choose, and obviously the Community impression that.\n00:08:24 Rawlings\nYou you give.\n00:08:25 Rawlings\nJust don't choose a course because you're talking about it.\n00:08:28 Rawlings\nBut what I can say is.\n00:08:31 Rawlings\nAnyone who can't change his mind?\n00:08:35 Rawlings\nCan be turned to be a layman.\n00:08:38 Rawlings\nSo from how I was brought up.\n00:08:42 Rawlings\nI need to get Jack of all trades, so I juggled between the engineering courses that I'd qualified for because Mendicino was not among my selection. Other than political science, it's really the political science or engineering and of the engineering courses, one that I could manage.\n00:08:59 Rawlings\nAnd I could.\n00:09:01 Rawlings\nAttribute my childhood days with telecommunication.\n00:09:03 Collins\nUh.\n00:09:05 Collins\nInteresting. Interesting.\n00:09:07 Collins\nThank you for sharing that.\n00:09:10 Collins\nAnd.\n00:09:12 Collins\nI also had you mention about your mentor, so I'm actually wondering if there are people in your life such as your, your family, your friends or mentors who have worked in the same field, and if they have had an influence in your decisions.\n00:09:31 Collins\nCareer decisions.\n00:09:32 Rawlings\nAnd.\n00:09:35 Rawlings\nNot.\n00:09:36 Rawlings\nWe have engineers, but not in my field.\n00:09:39 Rawlings\nAnd.\n00:09:41 Rawlings\nThe the other.\n00:09:43 Rawlings\nMaybe somebody who might have influenced my career chases my aunt, who's lives in Uganda.\n00:09:50 Rawlings\nShe works as a civil engineer, lecturer at Bustam College.\n00:09:54 Rawlings\nBecause nowadays offering civil engineering, but it's quite subject being offered is telecommunication.\n00:10:02 Rawlings\nShe told me about her.\n00:10:04 Rawlings How under developed the industries in Uganda and how I can tap maybe in the future days, though I've never put into consideration moving there to pursue my career because yeah, I love my country care, OK?\n00:10:18 Collins Great.\n00:10:19 Collins Thank you for sharing that. Thank you for sharing.\n00:10:23 Collins And so have you also had maybe or encountered role models or stories that have shaped your aspirations in the same space?\n00:10:32 Collins Pardon. Have you encountered any role models or stories that have shaped your spiritual in this same space?\n00:10:40 Rawlings Yeah, most certainly.\n00:10:44 Rawlings About the creation of.\n00:10:46 Rawlings I like fidelity by a Kenyan high school teacher from Myanmar in the year 2019.\n00:10:55 Rawlings During Sansei's point, Switzerland, he came up with a model of communication, or rather data transmission, that involved the use.\n00:11:03 Rawlings Light waves.\n00:11:04 Collins OK.\n00:11:05 Rawlings So it was.\n00:11:06 Rawlings It was a game changer in the industry and I consider among.\n00:11:10 Rawlings The few on the order to mention Starlink and how it has reduced its latencies.\n00:11:11 Collins Mm.\n00:11:16 Collins Mm.\n00:11:17 Rawlings Yeah, starting as an invention itself, not start to own a lonmas, but as an invention itself.\n00:11:24 Collins OK, OK.\n00:11:25 Collins Thank you so much for.\n00:11:26 Collins Sharing that. So what sort of information did you use to help you make decisions around your career choice?\n00:11:35 Collins For example, you may want to talk about guidance from school counsellors family.\n00:11:42 Collins The Internet, or just any other sources that you may have used?\n00:11:47 Rawlings One would be the Internet.\n00:11:51 Rawlings Because if you like just any other phone for live in Kenya, we will want to Google the most marketable course in Kenya.\n00:11:58 Rawlings Highest paying course.\n00:11:59 Rawlings It's a stereotype that's there among from 4 levers.\n00:12:02 Rawlings Wouldn't say I was. I was.\n00:12:06 Rawlings Bright enough not to follow, to fall in that category. But yeah, I googled it and most of the links or Expedia directories.\n00:12:16 Rawlings Had telecommunication drunk among the top ten, if not ten if not top five, yeah.\n00:12:20 Collins Oh, OK, OK.\n00:12:22 Collins Thank you so much for.\n00:12:23 Collins During that now to my last question, did you face any challenges or uncertainties when making these decisions?\n00:12:31 Collins Because now you mentioned something to do with wanting to do political science.\n00:12:36 Collins I also heard you mention.\n00:12:39 Collins International relations and now here you are in the in the space of telecommunications. So did you really face any challenges or uncertainties when making this decision?\n00:12:53 Rawlings Not really.\n00:12:56 Rawlings I was certain that was going to.\n00:12:57 Rawlings Was going to manage the.\n00:12:58 Rawlings That was one because I did the exemplary well in the course of the in high school, but the only other certainty I would have had.\n00:13:00 Collins Uh.\n00:13:08 Rawlings Was that in?\n00:13:09 Rawlings The Institute of Engineering in Kenya, Iek and the Engineers Board of Kenya.\n00:13:16 Rawlings There's a lot of conundrum within the management of those two entities.\n00:13:22 Rawlings And normally before 1 can get to practice engineering, whichever engineering it is, it's always a smoking.\n00:13:31 Rawlings There's always an issue to get your certification from the boards, so maybe that's the only uncertainty I had and still have.\n00:13:35 Collins Uh.\n00:13:39 Rawlings I graduate with Valediction first class or distinction.\n00:13:39 Collins That package.\n00:13:45 Rawlings Done in the institution, but getting the certification from the relevant engineering board so that we can now pursue.\n00:13:52 Rawlings My field of study might be difficult and they blame it, maybe.\n00:13:57 Rawlings To the ministry in charge, basically it's it's more of a.\n00:14:03 Rawlings Political.\n00:14:06 Rawlings I can't say.\n00:14:07 Collins Oh, OK, OK.\n00:14:09 Rawlings Yeah.\n00:14:09 Collins Thank you so much.\n00:14:13 Collins Thank.\n00:14:14 Rawlings Oh yeah. OK.\n00:14:14 Collins Thank you so much, Rollins for sharing your thoughts and insights towards this research.\n00:14:21 Collins I really appreciate the time you've taken to be here today.\n\n"

So let's start with a little introduction about yourself, Roy.\n\n00:00:51 Collins\nMaybe we could talk about educational.\n\n00:00:54 Collins\nCan you share what program or field of study that you currently pursue in?\n\n00:01:01 Roy\nOK umm I'm currently my name is.\n\n00:01:06 Roy\nI'm a student at university a second year.\n00:01:11 Roy\nThe School of P and Applied Sciences, studying computer science.\n\n00:01:16 Collins\nOK.\n\n00:01:17 Roy\nI think, yeah, yeah.\n\n00:01:19 Collins\nThank you, Roy.\n\n00:01:20 Collins\nSo could you tell me about?\n\n00:01:23 Collins\nThe schools or institutions that you've attended before college and how they've influenced \nyour current educational path.\n\n00:01:33 Roy\nIs in the high school.\n\n00:01:35 Roy\nI went to Congress school and I really appreciate.\n\n00:01:40 Roy\nThe efforts made in programs from from the people they brought in to encourage us that \nled me to.\n\n00:01:50 Roy\nDevelop an interest in tech.\n\n00:01:53 Roy\nFrom the I remember the the coming back to school and talking about check, check, check \nall the time.\n\n00:02:01\nMm.\n\n00:02:01 Roy\nSo I remember I develop an interest. Yeah. From that moment on.\n\n00:02:05 Roy\nSo take as the future, particularly artificial intelligence.\n00:02:10 Roy\nI really want to make motivated me and I really wanted to know what these AI is really is.\n\n00:02:16 Roy\nSo I really worked very hard so that I could get the correct.\n\n00:02:22 Roy\nClass of points too.\n\n00:02:24 Roy\nTwo, because I'm currently for swim.\n\n00:02:26 Roy\nComputer science.\n\n00:02:28 Collins\nOK.\n\n00:02:29 Collins\nAll right. So uh.\n\n00:02:30 Collins\nNothing, OK.\n\n00:02:34 Roy\nYes. Well, I don't think.\n\n00:02:36 Collins\nYeah, the London Brasco and the party just started mentioning both the primary.\n\n00:02:44 Roy\nAll the primary parts.\n\n00:02:45 Collins\nYes, the primary if if it had.\n\n00:02:48 Collins\nInfluence in your current educational path.\n\n00:02:52 Roy\nI really love you.\n\n00:02:54 Roy\nI can't say about so much. I remember I used to work hard, remember in the primary you \nused to just write courses you see in the primary level.\n\n00:03:05 Roy\nI wanted to be an electrical engineering.\n\n00:03:08 Roy\nThat was my I know I wanted to be a pilot because I used to remember when I was very \nYoung.\n\n00:03:14 Roy\nUsed to.\n\n00:03:15 Roy\nSee a pilot and aeroplane above and.\n\n00:03:21 Roy\nThis might be developed into be a pilot, but it went way.\n\n00:03:31 Roy\nAfter joining Nice School Yan, I opened my way.\n\n00:03:36 Roy\nSo the field of peakers the best choice.\n\n00:03:40 Roy\nTo pursue.\n\n00:03:42 Collins\nOK.\n\n00:03:44 Collins\nNot so great.\n\n00:03:46 Collins\nNot so great to hear and thank you for sharing that.\n\n00:03:50 Collins\nLet's talk about your future and.\n\n00:03:54 Collins\nI'm more interested in your career aspirations part. What are your long term career goals or \nthe kind of work that you envision yourself doing after you graduate from Kenyatta \nUniversity?\n\n00:04:08 Roy\nMy my main ambition, maybe the main thing.\n\n00:04:12 Roy\nI really want that.\n\n00:04:14 Roy\nMake me want.\n\n00:04:15 Roy\nI I really want to be a cybersecurity expert.\n\n00:04:19 Roy\nBecause the reason the info track.\n\n00:04:22 Roy\nRecord that shows that a lot of money selling from the country through subway attacks, \nand this made me really from that point develops start developing an interest in why \nshould our country?\n\n00:04:38 Roy\nThe threat to cyber crime sits.\n\n00:04:44 Roy\nCool. Just.\n\n00:04:45 Roy\nSo my really my name is be.\n\n00:04:49 Roy\nCky at the end of this Michael career. Computer science? Yeah.\n\n00:04:50 Collins\nOK.\n\n00:04:56 Collins\nAnd do you have any short term goals or steps that you're working on to move toward these \ncareer desired career?\n\n00:05:07 Roy\nYes, there is a shortage.\n\n00:05:10\nOK.\n00:05:11 Roy\nThere's shortage.\n\n00:05:13 Roy\nYou you set clear goals like what do I want to achieve by like for example.\n\n00:05:21 Roy\nThere are so many resources online live about the university education we are in currently.\n\n00:05:29 Roy\nThere are so many resources for like that you can use you.\n\n00:05:33 Roy\nTo research to pursue your feel interest. If you go on Twitter, if you go, you don't necessarily \nSchools.\n\n00:05:41 Roy\nThere are so many resources that can help you.\n\n00:05:45 Roy\nAlso, the lecturers in the institution.\n\n00:05:48\nUh.\n\n00:05:48 Roy\nThey help you shape up your books clearly about what you need to know.\n\n00:05:54\nMm.\n\n00:05:55 Roy\nWhich operating system is the best like that?\n\n00:05:58 Roy\nYeah, so I think.\n\n00:06:01 Roy\nThen I think causes.\n\n00:06:04 Roy\nI think there there there may help me.\n\n00:06:06 Collins\nWell.\n\n00:06:09 Collins\nGreat. Thank you Roy for for that insight now have these your careers changed over time or \nhave you always been focused on these similarities?\n\n00:06:10\nYeah.\n\n00:06:24 Roy\nIt should be done now as you continue growing as as you continue to learn when you enter \nfirst the university you want this, then you want this.\n\n00:06:36 Roy\nBut it comes a point in time.\n\n00:06:39 Roy\nThat you will see that you need to settle to a particular activity and right now my main \nFocus.\n\n00:06:48 Roy\nIs cybersecurity and nothing else, but those are my interests and sometimes with \nDevelopment.\n\n00:06:50\nUh.\n\n00:06:56 Roy\nAnd also that the science.\n\n00:06:59 Roy\nGenerated very high, but you see these things currently nowadays education system in \nKenya, there are minimal so.\n\n00:07:11 Roy\nYou see fire security as my ideal option right now, but if there are, I could have. But right \nnow I think I'm just simply focused on that only.\n\n00:07:24 Collins\nWell.\n\n00:07:26 Collins\nThat's so, so great, Roy.\n\n00:07:29 Collins\nNow I'd like to understand the reasons behind your career choices.\n\n00:07:33 Collins\nLet's talk about your motivations and your influences.\n\n00:07:38 Collins\nSo what really inspired you to choose?\n\n00:07:41 Collins\nThis field, the current field field that you are in, was it really a passion that you had or just a \nspecific experience or maybe other factors?\n\n00:07:54 Roy\nThe motivation that she told me to choose, I feel it.\n\n00:07:59 Collins\nYes.\n\n00:08:01 Roy\nWhat's close on the security check as I filled? As you can see in our country, but it's just a \npassion I develop.\n\n00:08:09 Roy\nExample, you go to a bank, an ATM machine speaking to you and when you ask about your \nbank, everything is taken.\n\n00:08:18 Roy\nYou see it? You sit down with your computer and start to learn coding.\n\n00:08:25 Roy\nSo I really develop an interest and see all. How can I begin?\n\n00:08:25\nIt's.\n\n00:08:29 Roy\nJust writing an algorithm for doing a wonderful thing like this. All these things motivated me \nto go to ATM anywhere.\n\n00:08:41 Roy\nBut even the best apps, so everything around us revolved by.\n\n00:08:46 Roy\nThis is what motivated me to come to take and see that the future of our.\n\n00:08:56 Collins\nOK.\n\n00:08:57 Collins\nWell, now that that's all, that's all.\n\n00:09:02 Collins\nI need when you talk about things like ATM machine talking to you.\n\n00:09:10 Collins\nThat that really makes you curious, and I think that curiosity it it drives passion.\n\n00:09:18 Collins\nNow I'm just interested in knowing if there are people in your life such as your family.\n\n00:09:24 Collins\nYour friends or your any mentor.\n\n00:09:28 Collins\nWho has maybe worked in a similar field? And if so, are these people?\n\n00:09:33 Collins\nInfluenced your decisions?\n\n00:09:37 Roy\nYes, exactly.\n\n00:09:40 Roy\nMy uncle is a really, really an individual, but always reminded me to.\n\n00:09:45 Roy\nStudy, study, study, study, study. Take.\n\n00:09:50 Roy\nIt's really in the a human resource manager that she has mentored so many individuals into \nthe tech field and show me their progress. So through him I've reached these individuals.\n\n00:10:02 Roy\nAnd seen their.\n\n00:10:03 Roy\nSo that's what motivated me.\n00:10:07 Roy\nTo continue to put more effort in this state in this tech field.\n\n00:10:14 Roy\nBecause it's really really in the end.\n\n00:10:20 Collins\nInteresting now.\n\n00:10:24 Collins\nWhat are the sources of information that?\n\n00:10:28 Collins\nHelped you to make decisions around getting it to take. For instance, we may want to talk \nabout guidance from school counselors, guidance from maybe your parent or your family \nMembers.\n\n00:10:44 Collins\nMaybe using the Internet as a source of information or just other sources? There are very \nmany sources right? So could you.\n\n00:10:51 Collins\nI know you may want to talk about this.\n\n00:10:56 Roy\nYes, the the first information I got I remember was an alumni from our school back in high \nschool. Somebody JC.\n\n00:11:04 Roy\nRemember him and and even recently I saw him in our interview on Citizen TV.\n\n00:11:12 Roy\nTelling that children you should start to be shown recording this guy really explained friend \nof tech. Really well that that was the first information I got about tech. I really after the \nmeeting asked him how tech was and he explained to me that this is the future.\n\n00:11:28 Roy\nThereafter.\n\n00:11:30 Roy\nMy uncle.\n\n00:11:32 Roy\nAlso motivated me and talk to me.\n00:11:35 Roy\nSet me.\n\n00:11:36 Roy\nExplain to me about Jake also there after after information from these individuals. I did my \nresearch online to see which are the 2025 most needed.\n\n00:11:52 Roy\nCareers.\n\n00:11:54 Roy\nAnd I should take as.\n\n00:11:56 Roy\nAs your top one of them causes intake, so this is really really.\n\n00:11:58 Collins\nOK.\n\n00:12:03 Roy\nIsrael really my soul, really. Source of information but not in front position, yeah.\n\n00:12:06 Collins\nWow.\n\n00:12:09 Collins\nWow, thank you for sharing that.\n\n00:12:12 Collins\nAnd did you face any challenges or uncertainties when making these decisions?\n\n00:12:21 Roy\nYes.\n\n00:12:22 Roy\nOur challenges may be there, but remember, somebody may be telling you coding is \ndifficult, requires a lot of time. My friend really succeeded there.\n\n00:12:34 Roy\nSuch like things so.\n\n00:12:38 Roy\nYeah. The kind of challenges you face, the guys there, you see meets that you're still telling \nyou, buddy. You really want Nigeria?\n00:12:49\nOK.\n\n00:12:49 Roy\nSo such like things.\n\n00:12:51 Roy\nAll right.\n\n00:12:54 Collins\nAnd and now.\n\n00:12:55 Collins\nHow did you overcome these challenges?\n\n00:13:02 Roy\nChallenges is the motivation. Maya, do you know when you have passion?\n\n00:13:08 Roy\nAnd discipline and consistency, you can achieve anything you want, but if you can really \nendure and be patient, you can get whatever you want in this field.\n\n00:13:12 Collins\nYeah.\n\n00:13:19 Roy\nSo it's no perseverance and.\n\n00:13:22 Roy\nAnd drawings and that will be.\n\n00:13:26 Roy\nThat has made me I'm being consistent in what I do is what has made me to continue being \nin this field.\n\n00:13:30\nMm.\n\n00:13:34 Roy\nThat's how I've overcome challenges and also surrounding myself.\n\n00:13:37\nWith people who?\n\n00:13:38 Roy\nAre also who you share common interests?\n\n00:13:43 Roy\nWith the negative individuals, how people share common interests with you share the \nChannel.\n\n00:13:49 Roy\nChallenges and.\n\n00:13:51\nRun.\n\n00:13:53 Roy\nYou really move on well.\n\n00:13:54 Collins\nOK.\n\n00:13:56\nYeah, yeah.\n\n00:13:57 Collins\nThank you so much Roy for for the insights. That's actually the end of the of the of the \nsurvey. I mean the the end of the interview and I really appreciate the time.\n\n00:14:11 Collins\nYou.\n\n00:14:11 Collins\nFood for this.\n\n00:14:13 Collins\nAnd I still want to just thank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

So let's start with a little introduction about yourself. Sammy, could you share what program or field of study you're currently pursuing in college?\n00:00:53 Sammy Yeah, my name is Sunny Samuel. I'm from... I pursue a Bachelor of Pharmacy at Jomo Kenyatta University of Education and Technology.\n00:01:04 Sammy Yeah. Thank you.\n00:01:07 Collins Thank you so much for sharing that, Sammy. Could you tell me about the schools or institutions that you've attended before college and how they have influenced your current educational path?\n00:01:19 Sammy Yeah, starting from my primary school, I studied in a school called Primary School. I was inspired by the teachers, especially my science teacher. My science teacher used to talk to me, giving me some inspiration. She usually wanted me to be a cardiologist, but due to some situations, I decided to pursue a Bachelor of Pharmacy.\n00:01:59 Collins Thank you.\n00:02:00 Sammy Due to some inspiration during my research in high school, I went to Canada High School, one of the best schools known for math and sciences in Nyamira County, Kenya. There, I was inspired by the students and the sense to study, especially chemistry. Chemistry inspired me a lot in my career. I was well-equipped with the study.\n00:02:45 Collins Interesting. Thank you for sharing that, Sammy. I'm so glad to hear that you are an enthusiast of chemistry. And now it has actually led you to your current career space. Now let's talk about your future. I'm interested in knowing what your long-term career goals are and the kind of work you envision yourself doing after graduating from JKUAT.\n00:03:14 Sammy Yeah, there is a way... I'm interested in research. I like research a lot. I like research about the drugs that are developed currently. I'm well-inspired by companies like Cambridge and Johnson & Johnson. My goals are to develop drugs which have minimal side effects and do not interfere with patients' comfort.\n00:04:25 Sammy In the future, I want to be a researcher. I want to be well-equipped in research, especially industrial pharmacy and clinical pharmacy.\n00:04:29 Collins Wow, I wish you so well in your future endeavors, Sammy. That is very possible. Now, do you have any short-term goals that you're working on or maybe steps that you're taking to move towards your desired career?\n00:04:48 Sammy In JKUAT, we usually have research clubs and student associations. In these associations, we have functions and outreach programs. During outreach or Congress, we meet some doctors who are already in the job market. After meeting them, they inspire us and explain how these companies work. Those are my short-term goals.\n00:05:41 Collins I'm so glad to hear that. Beyond that, you want to focus on research. You mentioned industrial and clinical research. I'm wondering if your goals have changed over time or if you've always been focused on this same path?\n00:06:07 Sammy From my childhood, my goals have never changed. Maybe in high school, they were oscillating because I was not sure. I was not purposely going into pharmacy. Maybe I wanted to do medicine. By the way, many people who join pharmacy wanted to do medicine. But after joining campus, I found out that pharmacy is also very good if you take it seriously.\n00:07:29 Collins Thank you so much for sharing that. Now I'd like to understand the reasons behind your career choice. Could you mention what really inspired you to choose your current field of study or path? Was it a passion, an experience, or other factors? Please elaborate.\n00:07:54 Sammy Yeah, a bit of passion. What inspired me the most before I joined campus was HIV/AIDS. Most of the drugs developed, like the ARVs and retroviral drugs, contain much toxicity. So, we need to develop drugs with less toxicity. If possible, we can even develop a cure for that disease.\n00:09:01 Collins That's interesting, Sammy. I'm really inspired by your passion and drive to want to provide solutions to the problems we're currently facing, like HIV/AIDS, which is a big threat to many people. Are there people in your life—family, friends, or mentors—who have worked in a similar field?\n00:09:32 Sammy Unfortunately, no. But I was inspired by my family. They usually give me support. My sister, in particular, provides me with support to study. I appreciate their support, even though they never went through this pathway.\n00:09:58 Collins OK. Besides your family or friends, have you encountered any role models or stories that have shaped your aspirations in this space?\n\n00:10:10 Sammy Yeah, many though they they never did because I'm pursuing.\n00:10:16 Collins Thank you.\n00:10:17 Sammy But there are.\n00:10:19 Sammy There are many who have gone through this battle, especially medical field.\n00:10:27 Sammy And in spite.\n00:10:29 Collins OK.\n00:10:30 Sammy All right.\n00:10:31 Collins That's interesting.\n00:10:33 Collins So what are some of the sources of information that helped you to make decisions around your career choice?\n00:10:40 Collins For example, have you relied on guidance from school counsellors?\n00:10:46 Collins Or your family or the Internet.\n00:10:48 Collins Any other sources?\n00:10:52 Sammy Yeah. And before I choose my course.\n00:10:56 Sammy First of all, I went through Internet.\n00:11:02 Sammy Then reconsulted some of the old boys in Kanga High School.\n00:11:08 Sammy There's my friend called.\n00:11:12 Sammy Pharmacy. He's in fourth year.\n00:11:18 Sammy So it was my. It is my mentor.\n00:11:23 Collins OK.\n00:11:24 Sammy He's one of the guys who inspired me to join pharmacy, by the way.\n00:11:29 Sammy And my high school chemistry teacher called Mr. OK, No.\n00:11:33 Sammy Yeah, it means that me and I decided to join the farm. Wow.\n00:11:40 Collins That's so great to.\n00:11:42 Collins Now I know you must be. You must have had.\n00:11:47 Collins You maybe must have heard a tough decision to settle on pharmacy, so I'm wondering if you experienced any challenges or maybe uncertainties when making the decision to really settle that?\n00:12:00 Collins Is now what I want to pick.\n00:12:05 Sammy Pardon.\n00:12:07 Collins Did you face any challenges or uncertainties when making the decision of settling to pharmacy as a career choice?\n00:12:18 Sammy Yeah, challenges were there.\n00:12:22 Sammy Because so many people like to disappoint you.\n00:12:25 Sammy Because not.\n00:12:27 Sammy Because this, this, this.\n00:12:29 Sammy But I stuck to my decision.\n00:12:32 Collins OK.\n00:12:34 Sammy Yeah, only that people who are wanted me to go another way and I wanted to go this way.\n00:12:35 Collins Alright.\n00:12:40 Sammy That was the one of the challenges.\n00:12:43 Collins OK.\n00:12:44 Sammy Yeah.\n00:12:46 Collins Thank you for sharing your thoughts, Sami.\n00:12:48 Collins Thank you for the insights that you've put towards this research.\n00:12:53 Collins Just come to the end of the questions.\n\n"

So, I've been reading a lot of books, a lot of things to do with politics, things to do with our country, things to do with the courts.\nCollins Otieno: Mhm. Okay.\nMakawa Tevin: And I learned through it that one of the ways that made me learn through about the career path of law is that there is this thing coming up where there is justice there is injustice in the law in this legislative part of our government. So through that it encouraged me that maybe I can be the change that's in that part of this government.\nCollins Otieno: Yes.

Thank you for participating in this research study about career choices among young people in Kenya. So I'll be asking you some questions about your career plans and how you came to make these decisions. There are no right or wrong answers and this is…\nCollins Otieno: because we're interested in your personal experience. This conversation will be recorded for research purposes and please let me know if you have any questions before we begin.\nTyrone Darren: No questions.\nTyrone Darren: We can begin.\nCollins Otieno: All Thank you. let me understand a little bit of a background.\nCollins Otieno: Could you tell me a bit about yourself and…\nCollins Otieno: what you're currently doing?\nTyrone Darren: Basically my name is Tyron Darren.\nTyrone Darren: I'm doing data science and analytics in USIU. basically …\nCollins Otieno: Mhm.\nTyrone Darren: what else do you need to know? What other information would you need?\nCollins Otieno: Okay. …\nCollins Otieno: I think that's enough information, Tyrone. Thank you so much. what level of education have you completed so far? Mhm. Interesting.\nTyrone Darren: I've completed secondary school level of education.\nTyrone Darren: So basically I have a high school graduate certificates and I'm currently pursuing a degree in the university.\nCollins Otieno: And now I'm interested in understanding your career aspirations and…\nCollins Otieno: choices. what kind of work do you see yourself doing in the future?\nTyrone Darren: H I see myself working for non-governmental organizations and…\nTyrone Darren: helping to tackle the problems that are most demanding in the particular society that I might be based in. Yes. So basically in my field of study I'm doing data science.\nCollins Otieno: And could you describe what a typical day might look like in this career?\nTyrone Darren: So basically a typical day might be perhaps collecting data and…\nCollins Otieno: Mhm.\nTyrone Darren: whichever form it may be maybe we're trying to solve poverty alleviation among youths. So perhaps we'll be out in the field collecting the data and then sometimes in the office the data anal analysis tools. Yeah. basically trying to find out the insights on those problems and how to solve them.\nCollins Otieno: Interesting. And do you mind sharing when you first started thinking about this career path?\nTyrone Darren: I said I'm more of a person who is concerned with environmental conservation, climate change and things that just deal with sustainability like protecting the mother nature and everything. So I was looking into careers that could help me achieve that and data science was a very good prospect in the sense that it allows you to gain insights into a lot of things. So basically it was around 2022 that's when I discovered data science as a course.\nCollins Otieno: I'm wondering how you learned about this career path. How did you learn about this career path?\nTyrone Darren: So apparently I do have an uncle who is learned. So even before I knew it existed, I'm sure he's in the technological space. So he told me about it since I also had to do my research and…\nCollins Otieno: Mhm. Okay.\nTyrone Darren: that's why I was able to connect two and two and I was able to know that it was the path I was to follow.\nCollins Otieno: And is there any other source of information that you used\nTyrone Darren: Of course, when I was doing my research, I used a lot of other sources. For example, going online, searching the prospects of it because they do show the jobs. it's a very kind of new career which is the jobs in it are going to be open till 2030. A lot of jobs are going to be open under this career. So it's very lucrative. So basically finding the sources from online internet service.\n00:05:00\nCollins Otieno: Interesting.\nTyrone Darren: Yeah. okay.\nCollins Otieno: And how did you come to verify or cross check this information?\nTyrone Darren: I came to verify this information by seeing other people who have pursued data science as a career and they've given their testimonials on how the career is and how it's going the salary their daily duties.  So basically by watching other people who have gone through the same path as me I was able to verify that indeed it's the right path to follow. Okay.\nCollins Otieno: for this career.\nTyrone Darren: They have learned that the job market is very competitive and the better you are and I mean the more skilled you are the better you are at getting employed.\nCollins Otieno: Mhm.\nTyrone Darren: It's very competitive and you need to climatize yourself with advancing technology. So you have to keep learning every day so I've learned it's competitive.  It has a good paying wage.  Yeah, the salary is also very very good and also the branches in which you can delve in are many because there's so many career options associated with the course data science so many I can just mention a few such as business analysis financial engineer big data\nTyrone Darren: specialist among others. So many. So it's pretty lucrative at the moment.\nCollins Otieno: interesting. And …\nCollins Otieno: what are the qualifications that are typically required for your career? Mhm.\nTyrone Darren: So basically you have to have a solid programming skills. you also have to have knowledge in programming languages such as SQL R and Python which are the solid foundation. Also you have to have a knowledge in mathematics and statistical tools which also help you to gain insight. So basically mathematics you have to be very good at math and the programming languages that I mentioned earlier and also you have to have a critical thinking and…\nTyrone Darren: problem solving skills. Yeah. What do you mean by compensation?\nCollins Otieno: Interesting. And …\nCollins Otieno: what do you know about the typical compensation in this field the amount that you paid after maybe the minimum wage?\nCollins Otieno: Should I use wage? just the pay.\nTyrone Darren: All right.\nCollins Otieno: Yeah. The salary.\nTyrone Darren: I know that let's say for people that I've seen they work like there's a person I know who works at Google.\nCollins Otieno: Mhm.\nTyrone Darren: So when you work at Google, the average salary for an entry job data science salary should be around maybe 150 to $200,000 a year.\nCollins Otieno: Mhm. Okay.\nTyrone Darren: Plus there also bonuses that you can be receiving associated with the company you work for. So that's something you have to to I think figure out if you do get a contract with the company.\nCollins Otieno: Interesting.\nTyrone Darren: So yeah,…\nCollins Otieno: How did you come to learn about this information?\nTyrone Darren: so as I said earlier, I've seen people who are currently working in this profession. So of course as experienced veterans they do tend to share their experiences and how much they've earned and…\nTyrone Darren: yeah that's how I got to know through people who are already in the profession.\nCollins Otieno: Interesting. And do you mind walking me through…\nCollins Otieno: how you came to consider this career path? Mhm.\n00:10:00\nTyrone Darren: Okay, I came to consider this career, but as I said, I'm very passionate about environmental conservation things that anything that deals with conservation. Yeah. And before you do that, you need to have an extensive amount of data in order to create models or predict such kind of events. For example, if you're dealing with maybe a global warming and climate change, you will need the historical data of a place maybe 10 years to date. So data science offers that because you deal with data and data is in abundance.\nTyrone Darren: There's a lot of data that is not being analyzed. It's just there. So I thought about it and I was like Sids, you can use data to make a change. Why not pursue this career?\nCollins Otieno: And Okay.\nTyrone Darren: Yeah. Yes,…\nCollins Otieno: So, I'm actually wondering if there are some people that you talk to about your career plans. Okay. …\nTyrone Darren: I do.\nCollins Otieno: do you mind mentioning who they are like who you talk to?\nTyrone Darren: To first of all my parents. I talked to the uncle I mentioned earlier who's cyber security. He has a PhD in cyber security. So he's basically a mentor when it comes to these things.\nCollins Otieno: Okay. Mhm.\nTyrone Darren: Yeah. among others.\nCollins Otieno: And what kind of conversations do you have about careers?\nTyrone Darren: The conversations with DP do have with my uncle is that it tells me to be more traumatized myself with new and emerging technologies so as to upgrade with the current system. As far as technology advances, they also advance with it. those kind of discussions…\nTyrone Darren: where you get to see the new things in technology such as for example we did discuss the adoption of XRP ETFs.\nTyrone Darren: I'm not sure…\nCollins Otieno: Interesting.\nTyrone Darren: if you're familiar with that but it's in cryptocurrency. So we do talk about similar things like that. Yes. This conversation has improved my thinking by making me to think on a global scale not just tied down on locally.\nCollins Otieno: And how do these conversations influence your thinking? Mhm.\nTyrone Darren: So I'm able to think outside the box and also it's enabled me to learn new things and also when we discuss certain things that I don't have knowledge on I get to go and…\nTyrone Darren: do my own research which also helps me to create a knowledge base. Yeah.\nCollins Otieno: Mhm. Yeah.\nCollins Otieno: Thank you so much, Tyron, for your responses that you actually giving me comprehensive responses. And almost to my last questions. do you know anyone who works in your chosen field? I understand you mentioned your uncle. Are there any other people who work in the same field? Hello. Can you hear me?\nCollins Otieno: So I'll just pick it from…\nCollins Otieno: where we left because it's a transcription. So I'll just connect the transcriptions. so Tyrone, I was asking you if you actually have any people who work in your chosen field. You mentioned your uncle, I think. So I'm wondering if you have any person who works in the same field. Mhm.\nTyrone Darren: No. No,…\nTyrone Darren: my uncle doesn't work in my field. He just works in cyber security which they're almost similar in the sense that what's it called? They're all emerging careers that are lucrative. But I do have someone who is not related to me by blood,…\nTyrone Darren: but He's a data scientist working for the UN.\nCollins Otieno: Okay. Mhm.\nTyrone Darren: Yeah. Yes.\nCollins Otieno: Hm. And how has knowing them affected your career plans.\nTyrone Darren: I could say it hasn't affected my career plan, but it has just motivated me seeing that someone I know can also get to that point.\nTyrone Darren: So, it's just the motivating factor, but not necessarily the activity factor.\nCollins Otieno: Mhm. …\nCollins Otieno: Interesting. And …\nCollins Otieno: what have you learned from them?\nTyrone Darren: I can say that I've learned that with get in this career you need to be hardworking.\nTyrone Darren: That's the first thing that you need to put in mind. And also they are knowledgeable about their profession.  So basically he has done a lot of extensive was should I say he has a lot of what degrees or something cuz he's knowledgeable about demonstration. Yeah.\nTyrone Darren: they've played a guiding role and the role. In my choices. They've not really been doineering, but they've just been a supporting factor. Yes.\nCollins Otieno: How have your educational experiences shaped your career interests? You just mentioned to me that you went through primary education and now into high school and at the moment you are in your tertiary level. So has your educational experiences shaped your career interests in any way?  Mhm. Okay.\nTyrone Darren: I would say they've really shaped it because when I was still in high school, I wanted to do something else. So, I can't really but I can say that they've actually helped in the sense that the things I used to do when in high school I've laid a foundation for my knowledge in the university level.\nTyrone Darren: So, I'm able to pick on things that I've done before. Yeah. Of course.\nCollins Otieno: …\nCollins Otieno: have you experienced any challenges or do you anticipate any in the future while pursuing this career?\nTyrone Darren: With every good thing there are hurdles that you have to face. Of course there are a lot of challenges that one of them being it's a very tedious course. So you have to really put in 101%. At times that is not possible. So you just have to keep moving and yeah I mean it requires a lot of effort.\nTyrone Darren: That's all I can say.\nCollins Otieno: Yeah, that's very true,…\nCollins Otieno: Tyrone. And now I'm wondering if you may require resources or support that may be helpful for you in pursuing this career.\n00:05:00\nTyrone Darren: If I may require …\nCollins Otieno: No, what are the resources or support that you would help you in pursuing this career?\nTyrone Darren: So as it support that will help me in pursuing the career I can say perhaps we can have more what we call trainings that better prepare you for the job fields also maybe basically training\nTyrone Darren: that gives you a real life situation of what you can encounter in the job field. Anything that I'd like to share?\nCollins Otieno: …\nCollins Otieno: is there anything you'd like to share about your career choice that we haven't discussed? Mhm.\nTyrone Darren: I think we've gone through every possible thing. Yeah. Yeah. We've discussed that it's an emerging field which has a booming potential. Yeah. So I don't think there's anything that we haven't discussed to the other young generation…\nCollins Otieno: I really appreciate the time you've taken to help me in answering these questions.\nCollins Otieno: And so finally, what advice would you give to other young people who are making career decisions?\nTyrone Darren: who happen to be making career decision is they should align themselves s with…\nCollins Otieno: Mhm. Mhm.\nTyrone Darren: what they passionate about. But they should do what they're passionate about but they should not forget also the world is changing so they need to also speed move with the change as well.\nTyrone Darren: So they should find a balance in doing what they're passionate about and also aligning themselves with the error that is at hand. Yeah. So you can't say you want to be your passion is about being an artist when AI is generating art here and…\nCollins Otieno: Mhm. Yeah.\nTyrone Darren: there.

I did my.\n00:01:38 Yolanda\nIn primary.\n00:01:40 Yolanda\nI got a grade of 320 that made me qualify for extra County School, which I went to Secretary Gilles High School, and I got a grade of C plus.\n00:01:55 Yolanda\nAnd that was a grade that qualified me to join university. I was called to do criminal justice at Kisii University, a university which I never wanted to attend.\n00:02:12 Yolanda\nI wanted to do something dealing with medical.\n00:02:18 Yolanda\nBecause that helps humankind. I love helping people.\n00:02:25 Yolanda\nThat's where I got a chance to join USIU, and I got a good course, psychology, which I'm so grateful for.\n00:02:36 Collins\nMore interesting. So would you want to share how these institutions you've attended before have influenced your current educational path?\n00:02:47 Yolanda\nUmm, for me.\n00:02:49 Yolanda\nFor me, it was, first of all, the foundation and.\n00:02:56 Yolanda\nSo far when I've noticed since primary, high school, and USIU, USIU has created a great opportunity for me.\n00:03:07 Yolanda\nExperiencing things like.\n00:03:13 Yolanda\nConfidentiality, being confident to.\n00:03:15 Yolanda\nIt builds confidence, and it also helps in gaining the culture to know different people. In high school, there’s also something called.\n00:03:27 Yolanda\nPatrol conflict, you know whereby, in high school, the teachers don't give you that good attention, and you read for yourself.\n00:03:36 Yolanda\nBut here in USIU, I've seen such a great opportunity, and it's really improved myself in my daily life, yeah.\n00:03:53 Collins\nOh, interesting.\n00:03:54 Collins\nNow let's talk about your future plans.\n00:03:59 Collins\nI'm interested in knowing if you have long-term career goals, the kind of work that you envision yourself doing after graduation.\n00:04:11 Yolanda\nIn the short term, the thing that I would like to do when I'm done with my degree in psychology, I want to do clinical psychiatry.\n00:04:28 Yolanda\nAnd start from employment while gaining something inside one of the companies, learning from one of the best companies, maybe in the US, and helping the community.\n00:04:43 Yolanda\nServing people and helping others.\n00:04:45 Yolanda\nAnd also, as for the long-term goal, I would like to build my own company that will help others. I would love to employ people and help one another.\n00:05:04 Yolanda\nAnd other people, yeah.\n00:05:06 Collins\nWell, so have these goals changed over time, or have you always been focused on the same path?\n00:05:14 Yolanda\nUmm.\n00:05:16 Yolanda\nFor now, I've just joined USIU.\n00:05:20 Yolanda\nIt has changed me mentally.\n00:05:24 Yolanda\nEven though things haven't been easy, it has changed my life in a way since I've told my friends that I'm doing psychology, and they've been really helpful. They've opened up to their problems, sharing them with me, and I've tried to help them confidentially.\n00:05:57 Collins\nThat's.\n00:05:57 Collins\nNow I'd like to understand the reasons behind these career choices, like the motivations and influences. What has really inspired you to choose your current career field of study?\n00:06:10 Collins\nWas it a passion or a specific experience?\n00:06:13 Collins\nOther factors?\n00:06:18 Yolanda\nFirst of all.\n00:06:21 Yolanda\nWhen I was in high school, you know?\n00:06:25 Yolanda\nThere were days when I gained some interest in knowing some sciences, biology, and everything. I was so eager to know why people are like this.\n00:06:34 Yolanda\nWhy do people think differently?\n00:06:37 Yolanda\nWhy are people, like, you know? I wanted to gain to know the interest of how the human mind works.\n00:06:43 Yolanda\nThank you.\n00:06:44 Yolanda\nAnd I normally, like when I was a kid, I would hear my mom say that.\n00:06:48 Yolanda\nI know you're.\n00:06:49 Yolanda\nYou will notice.\n00:06:51 Yolanda\nYou will know.\n00:06:52 Yolanda\nWhatever I'm doing, it’s something wrong or right.\n00:06:55 Yolanda\nAnd I would be like, how does my mom know that I'm doing this even though I'm lying?\n00:07:07 Yolanda\nSo I want to read the human mind and understand it.\n00:07:09 Collins\nThat's so interesting, Yolanda.\n00:07:12 Collins\nI'm wondering if there are people in your life, such as your family, friends, or mentors, who have worked in this similar field.\n00:07:21 Yolanda\nNot exactly working, but studying for it, yeah, there is.\n00:07:26 Collins\nOK. And have they had an influence on your decision?\n00:07:31 Yolanda\nYeah, they have influenced me in a way, yeah.\n00:07:37\nOK.\n00:07:38\nYes.\n00:07:39 Collins\nThat's so interesting.\n00:07:44 Collins\nHave you encountered any role models that have shaped your aspirations in this space or stories?\n00:07:50 Collins\nRole models or stories that have shaped your aspirations in this space?\n00:07:57 Yolanda\nStories are people like.\n00:08:01 Yolanda\nLike there's this one person, his name is Shaud.\n00:08:07 Yolanda\nHe's the founder of psycho-sexuality in human mind studies, and I want to know how a child behaves and why people behave in different stages of life.\n00:08:21 Yolanda\nHe has inspired me to pursue this, and from the book I've read, it talks about what’s happening in current events, which is really helpful.\n00:08:47 Collins\nOh, interesting.\n00:08:50 Collins\nWhat are the sources of information that have helped you make decisions around your career choice?\n00:08:56 Collins\nHave you had guidance sessions from your school counselors, family, the Internet, or just other sources?\n00:09:07 Yolanda\nPardon your question?\n00:09:10 Collins\nSources of information that have helped you make decisions around your career choice, for example, did you rely on guidance from school counselors, family, the Internet, or other sources?\n00:09:24 Yolanda\nThe only two information resources I’ve used are the Internet and guidance from my parents.\n00:09:30 Yolanda\nI saw the interest in medical health courses that I’m qualified for with my grades.\n00:09:45 Yolanda\nFirst, I wanted to do nursing, but I found out I’m good with psychology.\n00:10:04 Yolanda\nPsychology has really helped me a lot, and my mom supports me in what I'm doing.\n00:10:07 Collins\nAnd.\n00:10:09 Yolanda\nMy mom supports the fact that I'm doing psychology.\n00:10:14 Yolanda\nPsychology is a good course, and it’s an interesting thing to do, yeah.\n00:10:23 Collins\nYes, OK. Now onto my last.\n00:10:27 Collins\nI'm so happy that you're sharing that. I’m so excited that you’re starting psychology. I think that deals with human behavior.\n00:10:40 Collins\nSo the last question will be, have you faced any challenges or uncertainties when coming up with a decision on whether to pick this career—psychology—or any other career?\n00:10:51 Yolanda\nCan you repeat your question once more kindly?\n00:10:58 Collins\nHave you faced any challenges or maybe uncertainties when deciding on this decision to get into psychology?\n00:11:08 Yolanda\nI haven’t faced any challenges for now.\n00:11:13 Yolanda\nSo far, I have my path in that direction, and taking this course is better.\n00:11:22 Yolanda\nIt’s fair, and it’s not that.\n00:11:26 Yolanda\nI made a bad decision choosing it because some people judge certain courses, thinking they don’t pay well.\n00:11:37 Yolanda\nBut I’m so passionate about it, and I love what I’m doing right now.\n00:11:42 Yolanda\nAnd that’s what I want to do till my master’s and PhD level, yeah.\n00:11:42 Collins\nOK.\n00:11:48 Collins\nThat's so interesting.\n00:11:50 Collins\nThank you so much for your time, Yolanda.\n00:11:52 Collins\nThis is the end of our interview.\n00:11:54 Collins\nI appreciate the time that you’ve taken to respond and share your insights and thoughts toward this research.\n\n"
