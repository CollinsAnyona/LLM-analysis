Thank you.\n\n00:00:47\nYeah.\n\n00:00:48 Collins\nSo.\n\n00:00:49 Collins\nSo let's start with a little introduction about yourself, Arnold.\n\n00:00:54 Collins\nBasically your educational background.\n\n00:00:55 Collins\nSo could you maybe share what program or field of study you're currently pursuing in \ncollege?\n\n00:01:04 Arnold\nOK, so my name is Anand Anura.\n\n00:01:06\nI.\n00:01:06 Arnold\nAm a sophomore student studying Bachelor of Science in Nursing and Public Health.\n\n00:01:13 Arnold\nThank you.\n\n00:01:14 Collins\nAll right.\n\n00:01:16 Collins\nSo that's so.\n\n00:01:18 Collins\nAnd Arnold, good to know what you're studying.\n\n00:01:22 Collins\nSo could you tell me about the schools or institutions that you've attended before college \nand how these schools have influenced your?\n\n00:01:31 Collins\nCurrent educational path.\n00:01:35 Arnold\nSo I have attended various schools from primary.\n\n00:01:39 Arnold\nI attended Ober Boys High School Oberbaus Primary school in Amabi County.\n\n00:01:45 Arnold\nI proceeded to Kanga High School Kanga National School.\n\n00:01:50 Arnold\nWhich has been a major foundation and backbone to my current situation in campus. I \nthink my high school contributed more to the person I am today in that it molded me to a \nperson that is more resilient.\n\n00:02:04 Arnold\nAnd it helps me to gain the unwavering strength that it requires to surge around in my \nCareer.\n\n00:02:13 Arnold\nThank you.\n\n00:02:14 Collins\nThat's that's so great to hear.\n\n00:02:17 Collins\nNow let's talk about your future, and we could actually major into your career aspirations.\n\n00:02:25 Collins\nI'm really interested in knowing your long term career goals.\n\n00:02:29 Collins\nFor the kind of work that you envision yourself doing after graduation.\n\n00:02:35 Arnold\nSo I envision.\n\n00:02:39 Arnold\nBeing a global health advocate.\n\n00:02:43 Arnold\nI envision being a global health.\n\n00:02:46 Arnold\nI'm working in a career line where a lot of compassion is needed, and I realized that.\n00:02:53 Arnold\nWe are tending to get tired of compassion in the society. Yarin, fatigue, passion.\n\n00:03:02\nSo.\n\n00:03:02 Arnold\nIn a while.\n\n00:03:03 Arnold\nIs full of people undergoing a lot of trauma. People are having various problems and \nconditions which are only unveiled with these people, with this person's attitude.\n\n00:03:03 Arnold\nOf.\n\n00:03:13 Arnold\nThese patients need.\n\n00:03:15 Arnold\nCompassionate care, which at times they get they get deprived of because you realize \nmost of the health care workers are there.\n\n00:03:24 Arnold\nWorn.\n\n00:03:25 Arnold\nThey're out of energy. They don't have glucose, they don't get enough to work and so they \nget burnt out and they don't have enough energy to give compassionate care.\n\n00:03:35 Arnold\nPatient.\n\n00:03:36 Arnold\nI listen to their questions.\n\n00:03:38 Arnold\nOffering my services globally and to be a global health advocate, especially for the people \nin the reserved areas who do not get to reach for their healthcare services. When we look \nat areas such as from where I come from, I come from a place where is sickle cell.\n\n00:03:55 Arnold\nAnd patients do not get enough facilities and they don't always also get enough care.\n\n00:04:01 Arnold\nAnd so we realized that many patients die of concealed, and even where I come from, we \nhave malaria.\n\n00:04:06 Arnold\nAlso, malaria endemic area and these people do not get to know that they really \nprophylactic care.\n\n00:04:12\nOf.\n\n00:04:14 Arnold\nThis is malaria, so I envisioned to embody.\n\n00:04:18 Arnold\nA global health to global health coverage.\n\n00:04:23 Arnold\nI'm Vishal to see a place, a future, a country which the health is covered.\n\n00:04:30 Arnold\nOver not only that, those who are privileged to have enough money are the ones who are \nable to access the health services.\n\n00:04:37 Arnold\nWe have people who are really suffering. We realize that those who are coming from the \nlow income families, they have a lot of conditions which do not get to be realised because \nmost of the time they cannot, they cannot afford the health services in the hospitals.\n\n00:04:50 Arnold\nToo naive to know that.\n\n00:04:53 Collins\nYes.\n\n00:04:55 Arnold\nSo I I want to become some person.\n\n00:04:57 Arnold\nI want more to do in the society. I want to show the healthcare workers that we can still be \ncompassionate in as much that we have our problems.\n\n00:05:05 Arnold\nAre dealing with.\n00:05:07 Arnold\nI know it is so hard to be thinking about your own problems and thinking about other \npeople's problems as well. At the same time, you got to the hospital.\n\n00:05:15 Arnold\nOf them.\n\n00:05:15 Arnold\nThe patient, who is undergoing.\n\n00:05:16 Arnold\nLot of.\n\n00:05:18 Arnold\nThe patient comes present with a lot of issues.\n\n00:05:21 Arnold\nHe comes and says he has a chest pain, but when you sit and have good time with patient.\n\n00:05:27 Arnold\nWe realized that the patient has just chest pain.\n\n00:05:30 Arnold\nIt is a heart ache that this patient has. This patient has trauma.\n\n00:05:34 Arnold\nShe's breathing, traumatic, and she's piercing the heart. The patient has no one.\n\n00:05:41 Arnold\nThat is what the person I want to be a listing to listen to people and have them come.\n\n00:05:59 Collins\nHello sorry I I I lost you.\n\n00:06:01 Arnold\nHello.\n\n00:06:03 Collins\nI think it's because of connection.\n\n00:06:04 Collins\nYou continue please.\n\n00:06:08 Arnold\nWhere did you lose me exactly?\n\n00:06:12 Arnold\nWe're talking about being a lesson now.\n\n00:06:16 Arnold\nOh, I'm saying I would love to be.\n\n00:06:17 Arnold\nA singer to people.\n\n00:06:19 Arnold\nI am.\n\n00:06:20 Arnold\nWe are at a time where we are.\n\n00:06:21 Arnold\nWe are witnessing a lot of suicide being committed out here.\n\n00:06:29 Arnold\nYeah. We can see from the healthcare providers, university students, people commuting \nsuicide because no one is there to listen. And as people see it nowadays, that medicine is \nmore is a business just as any other cause, which is the wrong perception that people.\n\n00:06:48 Arnold\nWe should.\n\n00:06:49 Arnold\nWhich which makes me I want to be a.\n\n00:06:51 Arnold\nI want to be a role model to show these people that we can still be undergoing our own \ntrauma and problems and still walk people through their journey to a better life. Their \njourney to recovery from their aids.\n\n00:07:06 Arnold\nYes, thank you.\n\n00:07:08 Collins\nThat's so.\n\n00:07:10 Collins\nThat's so comprehensive.\n00:07:11 Collins\nI'm so excited to hear.\n\n00:07:14 Collins\nThe goals that you have, you know and how much you envision working for the \ncommunities that you live in.\n\n00:07:22 Collins\nSo I'll just go ahead into the second question, which is if you have any short term goals or \nsteps that you're working on to move to the desired career?\n\n00:07:35 Arnold\nYeah, of course. We we have a short, we have shorts and gold and currently I am working \nwith an organization called the Hawaii PC DN network. The young Professional Chronic \nDisease Network, Kenya.\n\n00:07:50 Arnold\nThe chapter of Kenya, which I'm the chapter leader of the Newry County so one of the \ngoals, is creating the awareness on certain diseases in the reserved areas, specifically with \nour last event was during.\n\n00:08:06 Arnold\nThe the the the Cancer Awareness month where we made awareness of cancer, the \nscreening and we we got to tell, we made short videos and clips on how someone can go \nfor screening.\n\n00:08:17 Arnold\nYeah. So those are some of the shortcomings to make awareness to people of their health \nconditions and also to talk to, to advocate for mental health, which we are planning to.\n\n00:08:28 Arnold\nVisit especially high school and campuses to have a session with students on factors \naffecting their mental health because you realize that most of this time people.\n\n00:08:40 Arnold\nHave they find it so hard?\n\n00:08:41 Arnold\nTo share with others about their problems and.\n\n00:08:44\nYes.\n\n\n00:08:45 Arnold\nDash, which is only meta femoral and they end up committing suicide as you think that is \nthe only solution towards bettering this.\n\n00:08:54 Arnold\nWhich is not the.\n\n00:08:54 Arnold\nSo we I envision a situation where.\n\n00:08:59 Arnold\nBy the end of the next year, we have some sessions on mental health talks, maybe some \nmay be placed online, some will be going physically when we get the time.\n\n00:09:11 Arnold\nTalking to these people and telling them, yeah, apparently.\n\n00:09:17 Arnold\nCause where we meet a patient you don't talk to the patient. We get to listen their side of \nthe story because you can never fully understand the situation that made someone how it \nhow the person is and what brought the person to the hospital. So some those are.\n\n00:09:30 Arnold\nOf the short time goals that I have enriching the Global health initiative.\n\n00:09:35 Collins\nWow. Wow so.\n\n00:09:36 Collins\nDo you think these your goals have changed over time or you've always been focused on?\n\n00:09:43 Arnold\nI think my goals have changed, especially this year when I got to go for my first daily \nconnotation at Noranga level 5 hospitals where I could see patients being and suffering \nwith no one there to support them.\n\n00:09:57 Arnold\nYou find, for example, relatives bring the patient and leave the patient there for you.\n\n00:10:01 Arnold\nThey don't even come to check the patient.\n\n00:10:03 Arnold\nIt really pains when you see someone on the deathbed.\n00:10:07 Arnold\nWhat? And you're at a point of helping these patients, the relatives abandoning the patient, \nand they only come when the patient has recovered.\n\n00:10:16 Arnold\nSo when I go to see how patients are continuously doing the morbidity rate of patients, \nespecially those with chronic diseases are increasing.\n\n00:10:25 Arnold\nIt really influenced my goals that these are chronic diseases are things that can be \nprevented, especially via lifestyle changes, so they don't get to be advised of their lifetime.\n\n00:10:38 Arnold\nSo this I think that really motivated me to really think that really motivated me.\n\n00:10:46 Arnold\nTo start this talk, this talks to patients on their condition.\n\n00:10:51 Arnold\nThe patient is just.\n\n00:10:52 Arnold\nThe patient knows she has cancer, but she doesn't know.\n\n00:10:55 Arnold\nTo do.\n\n00:10:55 Arnold\nShe gets panic attack and eventually she gets a she gets.\n\n00:11:00 Arnold\nA.\n\n00:11:00 Arnold\nAn anxiety disorder. Every time that she thinks that she.\n\n00:11:05 Arnold\nSo I think when I went to the hospital the first time I went to the hospital.\n\n00:11:11 Arnold\nI was found with a white pool of emotions in patients elevating.\n\n00:11:16 Arnold\nThe conditions was Hemingway, so that is one thing that really helped me, that that really \nmotivated me to be talking to people about the Primary Health care, how they can save \nthemselves from these conditions before they get them.\n\n00:11:29\nYes.\n\n00:11:30 Arnold\nYeah, now.\n\n00:11:31 Arnold\nAlthough I've always been, I've always been committed and focused in providing health \ncare. Since I joined the.\n\n00:11:39 Arnold\nSchool of Health Sciences.\n\n00:11:41 Collins\nOK.\n\n00:11:44 Collins\nNow I'd like to understand the reasons behind your career choices.\n\n00:11:49 Collins\nTalk of motivations and.\n\n00:11:52 Collins\nSo what really inspired you to choose?\n\n00:11:55\nUh.\n\n00:11:56 Collins\nYour current field of study, was it really a passion or a specific experience or just any other \nfactor?\n\n00:12:07 Arnold\nThat is a pretty interesting question.\n\n00:12:10 Arnold\nAnd I'll do that.\n\n00:12:11 Arnold\nLet me use this app.\n\n00:12:13 Arnold\nPassion comes it is passion, motivation and.\n\n00:12:17 Arnold\nHave.\n\n00:12:18 Arnold\nAlways been this person who has wanted.\n\n00:12:20 Arnold\nHelp people.\n\n00:12:21 Arnold\nI have always wanted to see people recover from their condition from their illnesses.\n\n00:12:29 Arnold\nAnd at a point when I was in high school, the time I had a broken arm and I got high, I was \nadmitted to the hospital for one week and I could see how those doctors were.\n\n00:12:34\nMm.\n\n00:12:46 Arnold\nN 0.\n\n00:12:50 Arnold\nOne day I have to position. I want to talk to people nicely. The way these people are talking \nto people I see.\n\n00:12:51\nOK.\n\n00:12:56 Arnold\nYeah, I recovered from my illness.\n\n00:13:00 Arnold\nI know this.\n\n00:13:01 Arnold\nWhere I was meant to be.\n\n00:13:02 Arnold\nI knew I was meant to.\n\n00:13:04 Arnold\nMedical profession at some point, and particularly nursing because it is the point that I get \nto have.\n\n00:13:12 Arnold\nComprehensive time with the patient.\n\n00:13:14 Arnold\nMm.\n\n00:13:16 Arnold\nYeah. So motivated by the fact that it is something that I've grown knowing that I want to be \na.\n00:13:23 Arnold\nAnd I think everyone should be having a mentor.\n\n00:13:26 Arnold\nMy mentor was always a nurse and I love the way she did her thing. The way she handled \nHerself.\n\n00:13:27\nMm.\n\n00:13:29\nOK.\n\n00:13:33\nMm.\n\n00:13:34 Arnold\nI really loved.\n\n00:13:34 Arnold\nSo I was like I need to be like this person, yes.\n\n00:13:39 Collins\nWow. Wow. Wow. So.\n\n00:13:42 Collins\nI was actually about to ask you that very same question. If you had people like mendazo, \nmaybe I worked in the similar field and how they influenced your decisions, but you just \nresponded to that and.\n\n00:13:56 Collins\nI'm so.\n\n00:13:58 Arnold\nThis to eat.\n\n00:13:59 Collins\nOK.\n\n00:13:59 Arnold\nMentally, people like.\n\n00:14:01 Arnold\nLook at someone and and.\n\n00:14:03 Arnold\nIt motivates you even though I know learning in Med school hasn't been easy to where I am \nat the point I am at now. It has a lot of bulwar.\n\n00:14:13 Arnold\nIt needs comprehensive self-discipline to be to, to, to.\n\n00:14:19 Arnold\nManeuver that, but at the point when you have a mentor, you see that this person made it.\n\n00:14:23 Arnold\nWho am I?\n\n00:14:26 Arnold\nYeah, I I haven't met. And the mentors are who are really motivated me to stay strong and \nto be at the point I am now.\n\n00:14:32 Arnold\nThank you.\n\n00:14:33 Collins\nWell, I'm just so excited to to to learn that you have mentors who who?\n\n00:14:42 Collins\nHave actually helped you shape your aspirations, especially in these critical space that has \nto deal more with human beings and their health and well-being, you know.\n\n00:14:58 Collins\nThat's so interesting, I know.\n\n00:14:59 Arnold\nYeah.\n\n00:15:00 Collins\nSo I'm just interested in the sources of information that have helped you make decisions \naround your career choice.\n\n00:15:08 Collins\nExample, if you've ever relied on maybe guidance from.\n\n00:15:12 Collins\nAre your school counselors?\n\n00:15:14 Collins\nYour family.\n\n00:15:16 Collins\nThe Internet or just other sources?\n\n00:15:21 Arnold\nCome up again.\n\n00:15:23 Collins\nI'm interested in knowing the sources of information that you've used to help you make \ndecisions around your career choice.\n\n00:15:33 Collins\nWhether it be it is a guidance from from school counsellors, be it from family or maybe the \nInternet or just other sources.\n\n00:15:44 Arnold\nOK, so I can see the family has freed up literal.\n\n00:15:50 Arnold\nIn in in in my in my in my in my journey towards my career.\n\n00:15:56 Arnold\nYeah, family majorly.\n\n00:15:58 Arnold\nReally, it's a it's a major.\n\n00:16:00 Arnold\nIt's the family where it is the backbone of all these.\n00:16:04 Arnold\nYou have someone to talk to someone and apparently I can see the people you meet.\n\n00:16:10 Arnold\nThe people you meet in in middle school, they they change it.\n\n00:16:15 Arnold\nAnd the people I have met, the friends I.\n\n00:16:17 Arnold\nMet they are they.\n\n00:16:18 Arnold\nThey are also a very good source.\n\n00:16:21 Arnold\nYeah, they have really helped me.\n\n00:16:24 Arnold\nI can tell the people I've met in my school, my family.\n\n00:16:28 Arnold\nAnd a little bit some at some point Internet, but majorly the people I meet and my family.\n\n00:16:34\nYeah.\n\n00:16:36 Collins\nSo just to the last questions, I'm wondering if you've ever faced any challenges or rather \nuncertainties when making decisions these these career decision?\n\n00:16:49 Arnold\nI have faced a lot of challenges, a lot of challenges.\n\n00:16:53 Arnold\nWe know when you're choosing a career you they're here says you here says that people \nsay that.\n\n00:16:59 Arnold\nNo.\n\n00:17:00 Arnold\nNo, you know degree nothing.\n\n00:17:03 Arnold\nYou know you're the person who's going to receive a patient who comes in accident and all \nthat blood.\n\n00:17:07 Arnold\nGoing to handle it.\n\n00:17:09 Arnold\nYou know all that you get.\n\n00:17:11 Arnold\nYou're told how hard things are, but in reality you get to realize that this is a moral vacation \nthat you're going through.\n\n00:17:18 Arnold\nBecause a lot of times either way you put up your chin.\n\n00:17:23 Arnold\nMove on with life and decide that I'm going to surgeron.\n\n00:17:26 Arnold\nGoing to have a newborn tenacity and I'm going to.\n\n00:17:29 Arnold\nIt through.\n\n00:17:32 Collins\nWow. Wow.\n\n00:17:33 Collins\nSo how have you been able to overcome all these challenges?\n\n00:17:41 Arnold\nSantander how I have been able to overcome these challenges one.\n\n00:17:47 Arnold\nIs looking at my mental. I look at my mental, I say.\n\n00:17:52 Arnold\nWow, she did it.\n\n00:17:53 Arnold\nCan do it.\n\n00:17:55 Arnold\nSecondly.\n\n00:17:58 Arnold\nI cannot let people down. A lot of people really believe in me and trust me and I cannot \nafford to let these people down.\n\n00:18:06 Arnold\nJust have to surgery.\n\n00:18:09 Arnold\nWe need a strong support system. The people around me have played a great role.\n\n00:18:15 Arnold\nIn helping me overcome the challenges.\n\n00:18:18 Arnold\nAnd I can also says.\n\n00:18:21 Arnold\nPassion with passion. You are going to defy.\n\n00:18:24 Arnold\nThe odds.\n\n00:18:25 Arnold\nThe challenges will come there, but with passion, you're going to defy all the odds, yes.\n\n00:18:32 Collins\nWell, I'm just so happy to to have you here today, Arnold, and you've shared a lot of.\n\n00:18:42 Collins\nInsights actually that are very valuable for these these research and I really appreciate the \ntime that you've taken to share your thoughts.\n\n00:18:54 Collins\nSo it's this the end of of our interview.

We should all listen back when developing ourselves.\n\n00:03:04 Ascar\nTerms of alliances, yeah.\n\n00:03:07 Ascar\nLucy.\n\n00:03:08 Collins\nAll right.\n\n00:03:08 Collins\nThat's.\n\n00:03:09 Collins\nSo you mentioned that you're currently pursuing medicine.\n\n00:03:13 Collins\nThink so?\n\n00:03:14 Collins\nAnd so I really want to know in throughout your journey, like educational journey from \nprimary to high school and now.\n\n00:03:25 Collins\nTo your college.\n\n00:03:26 Collins\nHas there been something that influenced this decision to you pursuing the medicine \ncourse that you you're currently pursuing?\n\n00:03:37 Ascar\nOK, I do see that from the.\n\n00:03:40 Ascar\nI didn't like I had. I developed my spiritual knowledge in high school all along from primary.\n\n00:03:53 Ascar\nSchool. You know something that you just.\n\n00:03:58 Ascar\nThen how we know how is an expedition within you? You know that I'll be a doctor one day, \nso I can say much of much of it was developed in high school and it was influenced by my.\n\n00:03:58\nYes.\n\n00:04:12 Ascar\nTeachers. Yeah. And my parents too.\n\n00:04:15 Ascar\nAlso having having more.\n\n00:04:18 Ascar\nI lost my grandfather when I was in home too during the COVID period due to cats and.\n\n00:04:26\nSorry about that.\n\n00:04:26 Ascar\nAt the better situation.\n\n00:04:30 Ascar\nAnd that's not actually the first.\n\n00:04:32 Ascar\nSo I heard that maybe you can try and see what's really behind this cancer thing.\n\n00:04:41 Collins\nSo sorry.\n\n00:04:4 Collins\nI'm so sorry about the loss and I'm glad to hear that.\n\n00:04:49 Collins\nYou do some of your aspirations from your teachers around, you know, and your family, \nand that would lead me to a question that I'd ask you in due course.\n\n00:05:00 Collins\nSo thank you for that response.\n\n00:05:02 Collins\nHer.\n\n00:05:03 Collins\nJust go ahead to the next question, which is to know.\n\n00:05:09 Collins\nAnd now that you're pursuing medicine, you know we've seen people going through some \ncourses and at the end of the day, they tend to do other things after graduation. You know, \nso is this what you're trying to?\n\n00:05:23 Collins\nMean. Is this the work that you're going you're envisioning yourself doing after graduation \nLike.\n\n00:05:30 Collins\nWorking in a hospital or working in your own, I mean, could you just maybe talk about that, \nPlease?\n\n00:05:40 Ascar\nThank you so.\n\n00:05:42 Ascar\nThe current interviewing is actually going to be a tough a tough one for the doctors.\n\n00:05:47 Ascar\nWe have much.\n\n00:05:49 Ascar\nWe have so many cases of people finishing their studies, then they end up in other career \npaths so.\n\n00:05:59 Ascar\nI have a thing in the field of treating patients having that patient doctor experience, but you \nknow as much as we as we go along, we realize that not everything we really want to.\n\n00:06:11 Ascar\nDo is what we want to do.\n\n00:06:13 Ascar\nLet me follow.\n\n00:06:14 Ascar\nOther things.\n\n00:06:15\nDown.\n\n00:06:15\nFor me.\n\n00:06:16 Ascar\nI'm usually working as a doctor, maybe in a public or maybe a private facility. As I said \nBefore.\n\n00:06:24 Ascar\nHaving this the last year, the finalist the finalists for the.\n\n00:06:29 Ascar\nYeah.\n\n00:06:31 Ascar\nLast are actually still outside there.\n\n00:06:33 Ascar\nNot been posted in time.\n\n00:06:34 Ascar\nYou know that before.\n\n00:06:39\nWhat?\n\n00:06:39 Ascar\nGo ahead, participate to, to, to actually be a doctor. You would have the license so.\n\n00:06:47 Ascar\nOther things.\n\n00:06:58 Ascar\nAnd having that notion of maybe working as a doctor, but in the field of medicine, not like \ndoctor, doctor, patient care maybe is some entrepreneurship.\n\n00:07:12 Ascar\nAnd.\n\n00:07:12 Ascar\nI hope to be ready for anything that can happen, but I'm hopeful.\n\n00:07:17 Ascar\nAnd that doctor, yeah.\n\n00:07:19 Collins\nAlright. Interesting interest. That's interesting ask so.\n\n00:07:24 Collins\nI'd like to know if you have any short term goals or steps that you're working on to move \ntoward these your desired career.\n\n00:07:36 Ascar\nHe shoot them girls I.\n\n00:07:38 Ascar\nThat medicine is actually so packed and having, like a whole year in school, having a one \nday sorry. A one week holiday, 2 weeks holiday and the maximum getting.\n\n00:07:52 Ascar\nTo a month would like a month and a.\n\n00:07:56 Ascar\nYou see that?\n\n00:07:57 Ascar\nYou have more of your time in school, so I think we should.\n\n00:08:02 Ascar\nLike we should be in mission to being school and having other things that along along with \nyou studies.\n\n00:08:10 Ascar\nSo actually I'm thinking of maybe which I'm thinking of studying.\n\n00:08:17 Ascar\nBecause like learning French, because may get yourself a chance in working in France and \nfor France.\n\n00:08:23 Ascar\nHave to know their language before you get to work.\n\n00:08:27 Ascar\nSo when you go, if you want to go for Father's Day, this you must know the their language, \nbecause that's what they use in school.\n\n00:08:32\nYeah, true.\n\n00:08:36 Ascar\nYeah, I studied the first book you have now is the language and mathematical enthusiast.\n\n00:08:43 Ascar\nI'm I'm also working on a mathematics course that I should have.\n\n00:08:47 Ascar\nCause. Maybe I'll get to working, maybe.\n\n00:08:52 Ascar\nYou you never know something like.\n\n00:08:56 Collins\nYeah, sure, sure. Alright.\n\n00:09:01 Collins\nThank you for that.\n\n00:09:03 Collins\nI'm.\n\n00:09:04 Collins\nYeah, I also love Watts, so I'm happy to hear that you're a mathematic mathematic \nenthusiast as well.\n\n00:09:12 Collins\nAnd so I'd really love to know if.\n\n00:09:16 Collins\nThese your goals have changed over time, or you've always been focused on these these \nImportant.\n\n00:09:31 Collins\nHello. Did you hear me?\n\n00:09:35 Collins\nHello.\n\n00:09:38 Collins\nHello.\n\n00:09:41 Collins\nHello Oscar.\n\n00:09:42 Collins\nSorry, I just experienced some.\n\n00:09:47 Collins\nTechnical hit and I unfortunately.\n\n00:09:50 Collins\nSo I left when you are when we are talking about something, right.\n\n00:09:57 Ascar\nYeah.\n\n00:09:58 Collins\nYeah. So I wanted to know if.\n\n00:10:01 Ascar\nYou're telling me?\n\n00:10:03 Collins\nSorry.\n\n00:10:04 Ascar\nYeah.\n\n00:10:05 Ascar\nYou're telling me about you being a mathematic?\n\n00:10:08 Collins\nYeah, about the mathematics emphasis as well.\n\n00:10:13 Collins\nAnd so that was leading me to, I mean the response that you gave me was leading me to \nmy third question on that part, which is if these your goals.\n\n00:10:24 Collins\nAre maybe changed over time, or they've always been?\n\n00:10:26 Collins\nYou've always been focused on these same path.\n\n\n00:10:31 Ascar\nOK so.\n\n00:10:34 Ascar\nMany goals, as they said, I've talked about having having having the interest of being a \nDoctor.\n\n00:10:42 Ascar\nI don't.\n\n00:10:42 Ascar\nFrom high school, then about the French language.\n\n00:10:47 Ascar\nActually wanted to do it as a as a subject in high school, but actually never got the \nopportunity because.\n\n00:10:54 Ascar\nI arrived late and the class was already full.\n\n00:10:58 Ascar\nWhen I bought mathematics, I had an engine.\n\n00:11:02 Ascar\nA career and he said with mathematic and then now considering I wanted to become a \ndoctor, there was no way I would be switched.\n\n00:11:11 Ascar\nBut I feel like I have that much, much passion in learning mathematics.\n\n00:11:18 Ascar\nSo.\n\n00:11:18 Ascar\nI was actually thinking about maybe doing it is another 'cause I don't know which course \nthat really entails.\n\n00:11:26 Ascar\nFor a long, maybe pure math or something.\n\n00:11:28 Ascar\nBut then I was thinking of it in from the medical field perspective.\n\n00:11:34 Ascar\nAnd I really that maybe because I'll just be having two careers, nothing like they, they won't \nleave having pure math and medicine.\n\n00:11:44 Ascar\nLet's really like I was saying because maybe I want to get to use these other career.\n\n00:11:50 Ascar\nAnyway.\n\n00:11:51 Ascar\nMaybe I'll just have it is.\n\n00:11:53 Ascar\nMy achievements, yeah.\n\n00:11:57 Ascar\nWow, OK.\n\n00:11:58 Collins\nThat's so great.\n\n00:12:01 Collins\nSo I just want to go ahead.\n\n00:12:05 Collins\nTo the the other questions which.\n\n00:12:10 Collins\nThat leads me to wanting to really understand the reasons behind your career choice.\n\n00:12:16 Collins\nSo what inspired you to choose your current field of study or career?\n\n00:12:20 Collins\nI think you mentioned something today in your family to do with one of your family's family \nMembers.\n\n00:12:28 Collins\nYou know, and also growing inspirations from the environment, which is your teachers \nAnd?\n\n00:12:36 Collins\nJust to mention of you, so was this your passion?\n\n00:12:40 Collins\nWas it really your passion?\n\n00:12:43 Collins\nOr you found other factors that really influenced your career choice.\n\n00:12:51 Ascar\nSo yeah, shouldn't.\n\n00:12:53 Ascar\nI wouldn't really say it's a such a passionate so, so much happening. You can die for.\n\n00:13:01 Ascar\nFrom the go I was just having it as a code then along the way.\n\n00:13:06\nThank you.\n\n00:13:07 Ascar\nIt's an interesting world having to deal with people understanding people.\n\n00:13:12 Ascar\nI'm a person who loves personal interaction with clients.\n\n00:13:16 Ascar\nWhat do you?\n\n00:13:17 Ascar\nWhy do you love this thing?\n\n00:13:20 Ascar\nYou have a.\n\n00:13:21 Ascar\nWhat she got this problem?\n\n00:13:23 Ascar\nIs it something you can?\n\n00:13:24 Ascar\nYou know something you can't solve, so that's mainly.\n\n00:13:28 Ascar\nWhat's?\n00:13:29 Ascar\nMe maybe having much of it.\n\n00:13:31 Ascar\nIt's interesting there going to the medical field, but then I felt like I really loved the \nmathematics more than medicine.\n\n00:13:41 Ascar\nFrom from the go at least.\n\n00:13:46 Ascar\nHaving to decide whether to go for medicine because medicine.\n\n00:13:49 Ascar\nThat.\n\n00:13:51 Ascar\nHaving person to person interaction, but mathematics is something when I sit down.\n\n00:13:56 Ascar\nDo it.\n\n00:13:56 Ascar\nBut I actually love it. I can go for all day just trying to find a solution to a sandwich I don't \neven want to help me anywhere.\n\n00:14:03 Ascar\nMaybe something like a get occursion?\n\n00:14:06 Ascar\nAlong the social media pages, let me just sit down to do something that is actually not \nrelated to anything you want to do. So I tell you they really love mathematics and I had had \nhaving to say whether to go for the field because I knew where they.\n\n00:14:22 Ascar\nGo for medicine.\n\n00:14:24 Ascar\nHave to be.\n\n00:14:25 Ascar\nIt has much entailed in it. It really needs to the passion that much passion to do it, and then \nfor mathematics, I wouldn't struggle with anything, so I knew.\n\n00:14:35 Ascar\nGood for the middle.\n\n00:14:37 Ascar\nPhilip, I have to have passion.\n\n00:14:40 Ascar\nGive much of my ideas and everything.\n\n00:14:42 Ascar\nBut for mathematics, I would just sit down and fast and kill.\n\n00:14:47 Ascar\nThat be.\n\n00:14:48 Ascar\nAnd I'll just wait for the exam so.\n\n00:14:52 Ascar\nI'd really say about passion.\n\n00:14:56 Ascar\nBut yeah, you get those two fields together, yeah?\n\n00:14:59 Collins\nYeah, yeah. Because, you know, I've heard you mention mathematics more than you know \nof study, which is a medicine.\n\n00:15:10 Collins\nI'd say maybe the passion is more advanced, right?\n\n00:15:16 Collins\nOh, that's yeah.\n\n00:15:16 Ascar\nYeah. Let's see.\n\n00:15:19 Ascar\nFor medicine, it's about mostly environmentally.\n\n00:15:24 Ascar\nDriven like, what's the what is the environment and having that passion to push?\n\n00:15:31 Ascar\nThat even person interaction, yeah.\n\n00:15:35 Collins\nOh, OK. So well, that is where now my the other place. The other part of the question was, \nlike, these are the factors that.\n\n00:15:42 Collins\nDrove you to.\n\n00:15:45 Collins\nTo medicine because you mentioned.\n\n00:15:49 Collins\nFactors that.\n\n00:15:52 Collins\nMaybe led you to getting into medicine like the person.\n\n00:15:57 Collins\nI mean the thing that you mentioned.\n\n00:16:00 Collins\nYou have something to talk about that.\n\n00:16:05 Ascar\nYeah.\n\n00:16:06 Ascar\nSo about the factors, I'd say that.\n\n00:16:10 Ascar\nMaybe she needs something you hope to practice in the each and every day whenever you \njust look at someone you're looking at medicine.\n\n00:16:19 Ascar\nIf you have.\n\n00:16:21 Ascar\nLooking at a person from a medical perspective and.\n\n00:16:25 Ascar\nIt'd be interesting just for another person who's maybe doing something else tourism, \nlooking at a person they look at person from a perspective of whatever this person travels \nthrough Germany.\n00:16:39 Ascar\nI'll have a trip to Germany for me.\n\n00:16:41 Collins\nYeah.\n\n00:16:41 Ascar\nLook at you.\n\n00:16:43 Ascar\nI look at your hand and.\n\n00:16:46 Ascar\nThis vein is superficial way.\n\n00:16:48 Ascar\nIt's kind of interesting and it's just like for a person.\n\n00:16:50 Collins\nYeah.\n\n00:16:52 Ascar\nWho was doing something related to?\n\n00:16:54 Ascar\nYou'd have to go somewhere like a Pakistan.\n\n00:16:59 Ascar\nAirports for you to see people are bring some air, but for me I just walk out of the house.\n\n00:17:05 Ascar\nLook at a person.\n\n00:17:06 Ascar\nThat's what I'm looking.\n\n00:17:07 Ascar\nI'm studying.\n\n00:17:08 Ascar\nI look at that person, I'm studying, so it's kind of interesting.\n\n00:17:14 Ascar\nHaving to look at a person from that view, then again having that.\n00:17:20 Ascar\nHaving that passion to help people.\n\n00:17:25 Ascar\nYou see, a person is sick.\n\n00:17:26 Ascar\nBut then you feel if you should help them, but you don't know what to do, so you feel like \nthat's what. If I do it, then I'll be. I'll be the one able to help this person to get. And then I've \nmentioned about having to interact with people.\n\n00:17:38\nYeah, I am.\n\n00:17:43 Ascar\nHaving to solve some issues.\n\n00:17:45 Ascar\nLike we have issues to do with mental health, we have issues to do with.\n\n00:17:52 Ascar\nThese basic things, like a person faints and nobody knows what to do.\n\n00:17:55 Ascar\nA person is epileptic and nobody knows what to do with the person. And OK, having you \nmay have a large crowd there, but nobody really knows what to do. You you're willing to \nhave, but you don't know.\n\n00:18:08 Ascar\nSo I'd say some of the issues.\n\n00:18:11 Ascar\nThat are really around us that we don't know how to deal with them.\n\n00:18:16 Ascar\nWe are carrying videos.\n\n00:18:17 Ascar\nIt's like there's no way everything today and how that that problem it would be there \nforever.\n\n00:18:24 Collins\nYeah.\n\n00:18:25 Ascar\nAvoid it, you.\n\n00:18:26 Ascar\nYeah. So I'd say some of the issues that was on.\n\n00:18:28\nWell.\n\n00:18:30\nWow. Wow. Wow.\n\n00:18:31 Collins\nThat's so it's so interesting. And so beautiful, yeah.\n\n00:18:37\nUh.\n\n00:18:37 Collins\nJust because of.\n\n00:18:38 Collins\nI just want to maybe touch on a few other questions and then we call it a day.\n\n00:18:43 Collins\nI actually mentioned that it was supposed to take barely 10 minutes, but seemingly \nexceeded.\n\n00:18:51 Collins\nBut now, would you now have you really encountered encountered any role models or \nstories that shaped your aspirations in?\n\n00:19:00 Collins\nThese medical space.\n\n00:19:04 Ascar\nYeah. OK. We had this notion of Ben Carson when you were in Class A class for around \nthere, so.\n\n00:19:12\nMm.\n\n00:19:13 Ascar\nYou know, it's totally interesting, I'd say that is one of the inspired me then actually have a \nperson. I got to know when I was just draining medical school and she was from this Abbey \nschool. She was from an extra County School.\n\n00:19:29\nThanks.\n\n00:19:29 Ascar\nShe did medicine and she's done.\n\n00:19:32 Ascar\nNow practicing.\n\n00:19:34 Ascar\nShe's actually, yeah, she's medicine.\n\n00:19:37 Ascar\nSo you get to meet her.\n\n00:19:38 Ascar\nPassword.\n\n00:19:39 Ascar\nAnd you feel like your mental ability is more than that.\n\n00:19:43 Ascar\nFrom that you should get from an extra County School or from a National School like that. \nWhy do I feel like I'm not able to do this?\n\n00:19:47 Collins\nYes.\n\n00:19:52 Ascar\nBut actually I'd say that.\n\n00:19:52\nYeah.\n\n00:19:54 Ascar\nAt times.\n\n00:19:55 Ascar\nGet to make such changes, but you realize that the person really had passion because at \ntimes you may study medicine and you wonder if that's really what you wanted for yourself. \nYou get.\n00:20:05 Collins\nYeah, yeah, true. Well.\n\n00:20:08 Ascar\nBut.\n\n00:20:10 Collins\nInteresting.\n\n00:20:15 Collins\nWow, that's so.\n\n00:20:16 Collins\nEspecially the part where you mentioned this person comes from an an extra County \nSchool and you're from a national institution. So definitely your brain capacity is higher \nThan.\n\n00:20:30 Collins\nThis this part I mean.\n\n00:20:31 Collins\nThat's so, so interesting. Now, are there sources of information that helped you to make \ndecisions around this choice? And if there is, what other resources such as maybe guide \nGuidance?\n\n00:20:46 Collins\nTells your family discussions.\n\n00:20:49 Collins\nOnline platforms or career counseling that helps you to decide on your field of study.\n\n00:20:56 Ascar\nYeah, I actually hate these.\n\n00:20:59 Ascar\nA documentary.\n\n00:21:02 Ascar\nFrom not a documentary, an article, something this this like, maybe a university publishes \na book.\n\n00:21:09 Ascar\nSo I had this book from.\n\n00:21:12 Ascar\nTo the name of this hospital. That's what deals with.\n\n00:21:16 Ascar\nOrthopedics in in Eldoret.\n\n00:21:19\nYeah.\n\n00:21:21 Ascar\nThe name. So I had the article from that hospital and I actually learned that it's more \ninteresting. Even they deal with mainly about doing disruption and everything.\n\n00:21:32 Ascar\nGive you those metallic things and you get to walk like other people.\n\n00:21:36 Ascar\nSo I saw it from that school. That's interesting.\n\n00:21:39 Ascar\nGet to give.\n\n00:21:40 Ascar\nPerson the opportunity to walk and.\n\n00:21:44 Ascar\nAnd then having to see when you go in a.\n\n00:21:47 Ascar\nVisited which hospital?\n\n00:21:49 Ascar\nYeah. And then you encounter more people doing.\n\n00:21:54 Ascar\nIf you see people are miserable in the hospital, the vulnerable, you can't help. Yeah.\n\n00:22:02 Ascar\nGuess those are mainly and then about the only.\n\n00:22:05 Ascar\nIssues from should be channels and everything from the family. They get to tell you stories \nAbout.\n\n00:22:11 Ascar\nPerson did.\n\n00:22:12 Ascar\nThey died because of this.\n\n00:22:14 Ascar\nThen OK.\n\n00:22:17 Ascar\nLike after learning after being in medical school for something really, that was a very small \nissue and they would have solved.\n\n00:22:23 Ascar\nBut then nobody knew anything about.\n\n00:22:23\nYeah. Thank you.\n\n00:22:25 Ascar\nYeah, hello is working long. Maybe somewhere like the other day we just saw a person who \nwas actually, she was almost dying. And the people around her didn't know what was \nHappening.\n\n00:22:35 Ascar\nLost like a mother. Then she was like, fainted.\n\n00:22:40 Ascar\nAnd then the people were not aware that.\n\n00:22:43 Ascar\nThen they they laid her in their own position and she would have died actually.\n\n00:22:47 Ascar\nSwitching the person to another position and it's highly the person who makes happen. The \npeople like you're a magician the most magician is something really simple.\n\n00:22:59 Ascar\nYeah. So I'd say the inventory.\n\n00:23:00 Collins\nWell now.\n\n\n00:23:04 Collins\nThank you for sharing but.\n\n00:23:06\nOK.\n\n00:23:08 Collins\nLastly, you mentioned that you experienced some uncertainties when making your \ndecisions between your passion, which is mathematics, and your current.\n\n00:23:19 Collins\nField of study, which is a medicine.\n\n00:23:22 Collins\nHow did you overcome?\n\n00:23:23 Collins\nThese answers to answers or maybe challenges.\n\n00:23:27 Collins\nLack of a better word.\n\n00:23:31 Ascar\nOK, head to really think about it. If I've done a mathematical course, I wouldn't have the \nopportunity to to do something related to medicine because medicine itself is a very \nLargely.\n\n00:23:48 Ascar\nDoing medicine, I realize that you can have the opportunity to actually practice something \nrelated to mathematics in the fields of research.\n\n00:23:56 Ascar\nMaybe this stage measurement laboratory?\n\n00:24:01 Ascar\nI have the opportunity to to do the mathematics so medicine is a very large field and I \nrealize it can accommodate this mathematics so.\n\n00:24:11 Ascar\nAnd having to wait about what are the benefits? Much more of the benefits?\n\n00:24:17 Ascar\nMathematics. It means the interest and everything because you get to like see many things \nrelated to mathematics daily. But then you realize that.\n00:24:28 Ascar\nI'm a person who loves people, people living.\n\n00:24:30 Ascar\nWill I help them?\n\n00:24:33 Ascar\nBut everyone is passionate about math and not everyone gets to encounter. \nMathematically, they won't after their high school education, they wouldn't.\n\n00:24:43 Ascar\nLove to.\n\n00:24:44 Ascar\nCome across the mathematics but for.\n\n00:24:46 Ascar\nMedicine you will get.\n\n00:24:48 Ascar\nYou need a doctor that you encounter medicine.\n\n00:24:52 Ascar\nYou you, you lose a loved one.\n\n00:24:55 Ascar\nYou have mental issues. Many things.\n\n00:24:58 Ascar\nSo medicines are large, building it can accommodate many, many, many things.\n\n00:25:03 Ascar\nCan.\n\n00:25:06 Ascar\nYeah.\n\n00:25:07 Collins\nThank you so much for sharing your thoughts and insights with me, Oscar.\n\n00:25:15 Collins\nI'm so grateful for your time. Your insights are incredibly valuable.\n\n\n00:25:22 Collins\nFor the purposes of this research, and I'm just so beholden.\n\n00:25:28 Ascar\nThank you.\n\n00:25:29 Ascar\nYou.\n\n00:25:29 Ascar\nIt's a pleasure to have been having me and sharing my thoughts and.\n\n00:25:36 Ascar\nIt's help another person, yeah.\n\n00:25:39\nYeah.\n\n00:25:40 Collins\nThank you so much.\n\n00:25:41 Collins\nI wish you well as you continue with your studies and.\n\n00:25:46 Collins\nWe're going to talk.\n\n00:25:49 Ascar\nIt's OK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I believe that's possible.\n\n00:03:35 Collins\nI really.\n\n00:03:36 Audry\nSo.\n\n00:03:37 Audry\nThat's my long.\n\n00:03:44 Collins\nCan you hear me?\n\n00:03:48 Audry\nYeah, I can.\n\n00:03:50 Collins\nI really wish you well in your aspirations, Audrey.\n\n00:03:53 Collins\nMean that's very possible.\n\n00:03:55 Collins\nThank you so much.\n\n00:03:56 Collins\nVery possible.\n00:03:58 Collins\nDo you have any short term goals or steps that you're working on to move towards these \ndesired career?\n\n00:04:05 Collins\nYou want to be a like you mentioned, being a very good teacher.\n\n00:04:10 Collins\nYou mentioned wanting to maybe.\n\n00:04:14 Collins\nI take an A post graduate education and then you move to the position of a of a lecturer or \nmaybe a professor.\n\n00:04:22 Collins\nSo do you have any short term goals or steps that you're working on to move to this desired \nArea?\n\n00:04:34\nYeah.\n\n00:04:35 Audry\nRight now I'm really working hard to make sure I graduate, probably with the first class \nHonors.\n\n00:04:44 Audry\nThat is my degree.\n\n00:04:46 Audry\nAnd after that.\n\n00:04:51 Audry\nYou can hear me.\n\n00:04:53 Collins\nYeah, I can hear you.\n\n00:04:57 Audry\nYeah, I'm really working hard on my studies to make sure I excel.\n\n00:05:01 Audry\nI want to graduate with a first class honors and do my masters, yeah.\n\n\n00:05:08 Collins\nWell, that's so good to hear. I think you really have to put a lot of effort now, have these \nyour goals changed over time or have you always been focused on this part of being a \nprofessional teacher or wanting to be a lecturer or university lecturer or a?\n\n00:05:27 Collins\nProfessor.\n\n00:05:35\nNo.\n\n00:05:37 Audry\nMy ghosts haven't changed like the moment my dad started lecturing. That's when I \nStarted.\n\n00:05:48 Audry\nHaving that eyes to be like him, I wanted to be better than him, actually, and that's what I'm \nreally trying to do right now.\n\n00:05:59 Audry\nWhat I'm working on.\n\n00:06:04 Collins\nYeah. OK. OK.\n\n00:06:06 Collins\nThat answers my question.\n\n00:06:08 Collins\nNow I'd like to understand the reasons behind behind your career choices. Maybe the \nmotivations and the influences.\n\n00:06:17 Collins\nTowards your career choice, and I'm really interested in knowing what inspired you to \nchoose your current field of study.\n\n00:06:25 Collins\nAnd I'm also wondering if this was a passion or a specific experience or.\n\n00:06:32 Collins\nThe influence just came from other factors.\n\n00:06:45 Audry\nPardon me, may I get the question again?\n00:06:48 Collins\nYeah, I'm interested in knowing what really inspired you to choose your current field of \nstudy, that is.\n\n00:06:56 Collins\nEducation. I'm wondering if it was a passion or just a specific experience or.\n\n00:07:03 Collins\nThe inspiration just to do what I mean was just drawn from other factors.\n\n00:07:14 Audry\nI'd say it's it's passion, because really I'd love it when people learn from.\n\n00:07:19 Audry\nI'd love it when I teach people what I know, and I also love it when I learn from others. \nBecause, you know, when you teach, you also learn from people.\n\n00:07:30 Collins\nYes.\n\n00:07:30 Audry\nSo you give them knowledge you pass as you get.\n\n00:07:35 Audry\nNew knowledge to.\n\n00:07:37 Audry\nYeah, so I feel.\n\n00:07:41 Audry\nSomething great to do, OK.\n\n00:07:45 Collins\nAnd other people in your family, maybe your family, your friends.\n\n00:07:46\nYeah.\n\n00:07:50 Collins\nI mean other people in your life, maybe your family, your friends or just mentors who have \nworked in a similar field.\n\n00:08:00 Audry\nYeah.\n00:08:04 Audry\nBut my parents teach us.\n\n00:08:05 Collins\nOK.\n\n00:08:08 Collins\nThat that's all great.\n\n00:08:08 Audry\nMigrant Farm was a teacher too.\n\n00:08:12 Collins\nOK.\n\n00:08:14 Collins\nInteresting, interesting, and influenced your decision to choosing teaching as a career.\n\n00:08:14 Audry\nYeah.\n00:08:24 Audry\nYeah, my dad has.\n\n00:08:27 Collins\nOK. Would you want to maybe talk more about that?\n\n00:08:37 Collins\nIf no, it's OK.\n\n00:08:44 Audry\nLet's let's move. Let's move on\n\n00:08:46 Collins\nOK, OK.\n\n00:08:50 Collins\nI'm wondering if there are stories of inspiration that the stories, or rather role models that \nhave shaped your aspirations in the space of of education, or rather teaching.\n\n00:09:07 Audry\nI'd say my dad is my role model.\n\n00:09:12\nThank you.\n00:09:14\nOK.\n\n00:09:18 Collins\nDo you have any sources of information that helped you to make decisions around your \ncareer choice?\n\n00:09:24 Collins\nLet's talk about.\n\n00:09:27 Collins\nMaybe guidance from your school counselors.\n\n00:09:31 Collins\nThe Internet or other sources, I mean, you know, when you're in such a field, perhaps you \nhad a couple.\n\n00:09:39 Collins\nDecisions that you are supposed to make.\n\n00:09:41 Collins\nLet's talk about. Maybe you had to choose between medicine or education or.\n\n00:09:51 Collins\nPharmacy or I mean the couple careers out?\n\n00:09:54 Collins\nSo in choosing careers, perhaps you may want to get yourself a lot of information before \nyou make that decision.\n\n00:10:03 Collins\nI'm wondering if you've had.\n\n00:10:07 Collins\nSome sources of information.\n\n00:10:08 Collins\nThat have helped you.\n\n00:10:10 Collins\nMake these decisions around your career choice.\n\n00:10:16 Audry\nYeah, I used to have this teacher in high school.\n00:10:21 Audry\nWho used to tell me he used to tell me I look good.\n\n00:10:26\nOK.\n\n00:10:27 Audry\nWhen I'll become a teacher, but I I can start.\n\n00:10:30 Audry\nSo what?\n\n00:10:31 Audry\nSo.\n\n00:10:35 Audry\nI I looked.\n\n00:10:37 Audry\nTeaching from the Internet and everything I was looking at my parents too, and I'd ask my \ndad pia a lot of questions.\n\n00:10:50 Audry\nIndia from the information I got.\n\n00:10:56 Audry\nInformation I got from.\n\n00:10:58 Audry\nMy high school teacher and from the Internet and from my dad.\n\n00:11:03 Audry\nThey led me to choosing this career.\n\n00:11:08 Collins\nThat's so interesting to hear.\n\n00:11:11 Collins\nOn my last question, have you faced any uncertainty?\n\n00:11:16 Collins\nOr challenges when making decision of making an educational.\n\n\n00:11:26 Audry\nYeah, challenges are all over.\n\n00:11:29 Audry\nLike for example.\n\n00:11:30 Audry\nAround me.\n\n00:11:33 Audry\nMost people in Kenya really demean and degrade education. They took away, you know \nThat.\n\n00:11:44 Audry\nAnd to some extent, it's discouraging, you know.\n\n00:11:51 Collins\nSo how did you come to overcome?\n\n00:11:54 Collins\nYeah, it's very that's very true that most people they'll tell you, you know, education is not \nthe best career for you maybe and what not I mean.\n\n00:12:07 Collins\nBut at the end of the day, you are here now and that is what you decided.\n\n00:12:12 Collins\nSo I'm wondering how you manage to overcome all these negative thoughts and what not.\n\n00:12:22 Audry\nWell.\n\n00:12:28 Audry\nAs I mentioned earlier, I'm doing this because of passion, so I just decided to follow my \nHeart.\n\n00:12:35 Audry\nI I know what I want and that's what I'm working to achieve. I'm working.\n\n00:12:42 Audry\nTo make sure I become that person that I want to be.\n\n00:12:45 Audry\nSo I avoid listening to those negative comments and they focus on the positive ones just to \nmake sure I reach where I want to go.\n\n00:12:58 Collins\nThank you so much for.\n\n00:12:59 Collins\nThank you for sharing your thoughts and thank you for taking your time.\n\n00:13:05 Collins\nThere you are.

Uh.\n\n00:01:21 Bethuel\nAre you together?\n\n00:01:23 Collins\nYes, I can hear you.\n\n00:01:25 Bethuel\nOh, give me a minute first.\n\n00:01:28 Bethuel\nI'm trying to connect my, I mean.\n\n00:01:31 Bethuel\nOK, no problem.\n\n00:01:33 Bethuel\nJust a minute.\n\n00:01:44 Bethuel\nJust a minute.\n\n\n00:02:01 Bethuel\nJust are you together still?\n\n00:02:02 Collins\nYeah, we're together.\n\n00:02:05 Bethuel\nOK, one minute.\n\n00:02:06\nOK.\n\n00:02:06 Collins\nNo problem.\n\n00:02:41\nOK.\n\n00:02:42 Collins\nSo can you share what program of Windows study you're currently pursuing in college or \nOK?\n\n00:02:48 Collins\nSorry, I think you already answered.\n\n00:02:50 Collins\nCould you tell me about the institutions you've attended before college and how they've \ninfluenced your current educational path?\n\n00:02:59 Bethuel\nSo I went to such a high school, which is located at Barringo.\n\n00:03:03 Collins\nOK.\n\n00:03:05 Bethuel\nWith this nimi with the background I had in such a high school.\n\n00:03:10 Bethuel\nIt was a tough background, I I guess all of you know what that choice school is located at.\n\n00:03:15 Collins\nOK.\n\n00:03:16 Bethuel\nLet me develop this skill of problem.\n\n00:03:19 Bethuel\nI had this passion of problems cause solving skills because of where I came from, which is \nsuch a high school where I started from.\n\n00:03:27 Bethuel\nAnd by doing this it helped.\n\n00:03:29 Bethuel\nI was fascinated with the problems solving skills, and I thought that software software \nengineering will suit my.\n\n00:03:36 Bethuel\nMy goals?\n\n00:03:38 Collins\nOK.\n\n00:03:39 Bethuel\nI don't know if I'm answering the right way, but I'll try OK.\n\n00:03:40 Collins\nYeah, that would be great. OK.\n\n00:03:43 Collins\nThank you for answer for that response, Beth.\n\n00:03:46 Collins\t\nLet's talk about your future now.\n\n00:03:48 Collins\t\t\nWhat are your long term career goals or the kind of work that you envision yourself doing \nafter graduation?\t\n\n00:03:55 Bethuel\nOK, my long term goals is first of all I want to take a role of leadership in any of the software \nengineering companies.\n\n00:04:03 Collins\nUh.\n\n\n00:04:04 Bethuel\nMaybe become a senior engineer or technical architect in that company.\n\n00:04:10 Bethuel\nSecondly, I want to set set up my business.\n\n00:04:13\nMm.\n\n00:04:14 Bethuel\nOf basically the tech field and try to make Lambda somethings like games.\n\n00:04:20 Bethuel\nIt will generate a lot of revenue for me and the country also.\n\n00:04:25 Collins\nOK.\n\n00:04:27 Bethuel\nYeah. And also as time goes by, I want to be maybe a mentor.\n\n00:04:27 Collins\nThat sounds so great. And then?\n\n00:04:32 Bethuel\nThat I can just guide other people, the upcoming software engineer.\n\n00:04:36 Collins\nThat's so great to hear.\n\n00:04:38 Collins\nWell, thank you so much for that response.\n\n00:04:40 Collins\nDo you have any short term goals or steps that you're working on to move you toward that \ndesired career?\n\n00:04:47 Bethuel\nOK, my short term goals is first of all, master the core skills of software engineering.\n\n00:04:53 Bethuel\nMaster the programming languages such as the JavaScript MM.\n\n\n00:05:01 Bethuel\nI want to build a strong foundation.\n\n00:05:03 Bethuel\nMm.\n\n00:05:04 Bethuel\nSo that I can focus on understanding software engineering, the principles and the \nalgorithm and data structures.\n\n00:05:12 Bethuel\nYeah, I think that's all.\n\n00:05:14 Collins\nYeah, interesting. Interesting practical experience of the work.\n\n00:05:16 Bethuel\nAnd practically.\n\n00:05:19 Collins\nOK, I see.\n\n00:05:21 Collins\nYeah. Now I'm wondering if you've always been focused on this goal of doing software \nengineering or it has changed over time.\n\n00:05:32 Bethuel\nDon't exchange overtime. I won't lie.\n\n00:05:36 Bethuel\nYes.\n\n00:05:38 Collins\nAh, OK.\n\n00:05:39 Collins\nNow I'd like to understand the reason.\n\n00:05:41 Collins\nAnd your career choices like the motivations and influences.\n\n00:05:46 Collins\nSo what really inspired you to choose software engineering as a as a career path?\n\n00:05:51 Collins\nWas it a passion, a specific experience or just other factors?\n\n00:05:56 Bethuel\nWell, it's basically my passion of computers.\n\n00:06:01 Bethuel\nYeah, that's.\n\n00:06:02 Bethuel\nThat's what I said me to take on the course and see if I can learn more about the \ncomputers, because for a really long time, I really want to do things related to computers.\n\n00:06:13 Collins\nOK.\n\n00:06:14 Collins\nAnd other people in your life, such as family, friends or mentors who have worked, who \nhave worked in the same field.\n\n00:06:20 Bethuel\nYeah.\n00:06:23 Bethuel\nYes, yes, actually my cousin.\n00:06:26 Bethuel\nUh, huh. He's also doing software engineering.\n00:06:31 Bethuel\nYes.\n00:06:32 Collins\nAnd did your cousin have an influence in your decision to settle on software engineering?\n00:06:40 Bethuel\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n00:06:43 Collins\nOK, OK. Interesting. And have you encountered any role models or stories that have shaped your aspirations in this same space now?\n00:06:53 Bethuel\nFor now, I think I'll just say my cousin.\n00:06:56 Collins\nOK.\n00:06:56 Bethuel\nBecause he has really been a strong factor in me choosing this.\n00:07:00 Collins\nOK.\n00:07:02 Collins\nAnd now I'm interested in knowing the sources of information that have helped you to make decisions around your career choice. For example, have you relied on guidance from your school counsellor or...?\n00:07:15 Bethuel\nBut yeah, there are some people in my school, Desert High School.\n00:07:20 Bethuel\nUh, huh. Who guided us about a variety of courses. OK. And I think that engineering caught my eye.\n00:07:29 Bethuel\nBecause at least it could relate to the things I love, such as computers, as I've mentioned earlier.\n00:07:36 Collins\nOK.\n00:07:38 Collins\nOK. Interesting.\n00:07:41 Collins\nYeah. Well, finally, I think there's usually that temptation: Is this really the best course for me after high school?\n00:07:50 Collins\nYou know, so I'm wondering if you ever faced any challenges or uncertainties when making these decisions?\n00:07:59 Bethuel\nSo you can, could you repeat the question?\n00:08:02 Collins\nDid you face any challenges or uncertainties when making this decision to settle on software engineering?\n00:08:11 Bethuel\nNot really.\n00:08:13\nOK.\n00:08:14 Bethuel\nNot really.\n00:08:14 Collins\nYes. Ah.\n00:08:16 Collins\nSo thank you so much, Bethuel, for sharing your thoughts.\n00:08:20 Collins\nYour insights are incredibly valuable for the purposes of this...\n\n"

        "content": "Audio file\n00:00:03 Collins\nYeah. So hi, Denis. Thank you for joining me today.\n00:00:07 Collins\nI really appreciate the time you've taken.\n00:00:11 Collins\nTo perform this today, and before I begin, I just want to let you know that these are short surveys aimed at understanding the career aspirations and motivations of African students.\n00:00:25 Collins\nYour responses will be kept confidential and are going to be used only for the study purposes.\n00:00:33 Collins\nThe session should take about 10 minutes.\n00:00:37 Collins\nAnd through the organization, I’ll be asking you questions about your studies, your career goals, and the motivations behind your choices.\n00:00:47 Collins\nSo just feel free to answer as openly as you're comfortable with.\n00:00:53 Collins\nDoes that make sense, Denis?\n00:00:59 Denis\nYes.\n00:01:00 Collins\nSo let's start with a brief introduction about yourself. You may want to talk about your educational background.\n00:01:08 Collins\nCan you share what program or field of study you're currently pursuing in college?\n00:01:16 Denis\nOK. About my introduction, I'm really switching.\n00:01:23 Denis\nCurrently.\n00:01:26 Denis\nI’m in Eldoret, Moi University, School of Law.\n00:01:32 Denis\nUndergraduate degree.\n00:01:35 Denis\nAs for my brief education background...\n00:01:38 Denis\nOh, I did my primary school education in a village school back in Nyamira County.\n00:01:45 Denis\nAfter completing KCPE, I joined Nyamira Boys’ High School for my secondary education.\n00:01:52 Collins\nThank you.\n00:01:53 Denis\nI think that’s enough for now.\n00:01:55 Collins\nYeah, that’s very comprehensive, Denis.\n00:01:58 Collins\nThank you for that. And in fact, you've gone ahead with such comprehensive responses that you’ve actually answered the question that was yet to follow, which was...\n00:02:10 Collins\nThe schools or institutions that you've attended before college.\n00:02:14 Denis\nYeah.\n00:02:16 Collins\nThe other part of the question would have been how these institutions have actually influenced your current educational path. Now that you're in Moi University...\n00:02:26 Collins\nIs there a way the previous institutions that you’ve attended have influenced your current educational path?\n00:02:38 Denis\nYes, actually, it’s obvious.\n00:02:40 Denis\nThe high school that I went to actually influenced my career path.\n00:02:48 Denis\nBecause, as you know, in school...\n00:02:49 Denis\nYou have to work hard in order to get those jobs or careers that are, let’s say, considered more prestigious or valued compared to others.\n00:03:04 Denis\nYeah.\n00:03:07 Collins\nOK.\n00:03:08 Denis\nAnd so, that’s what motivated me, yeah.\n00:03:12 Collins\nInteresting. Interesting, Denis. Thank you for sharing.\n00:03:17 Collins\nLet’s talk about your future. I’m interested in knowing your career aspirations.\n00:03:22 Collins\nWhat are your long-term career goals or the kind of work that you envision yourself doing after you graduate from Moi University?\n00:03:34 Denis\nOK, obviously, after graduating from Moi University...\n00:03:40 Denis\nFor law students, in order to practice law in Kenya, you have to join the Kenya School of Law, where you have to obtain that diploma.\n00:03:51 Denis\nWhich is essential for focusing on law.\n00:03:55 Denis\nSo, for my career path, I am aiming to go even higher—not just to be called an advocate, but to earn additional titles.\n00:04:05 Denis\nLike...\n00:04:10 Denis\nGod willing, after completing that course at the Kenya School of Law,\n00:04:17 Denis\nI would want to go for a Master’s if possible, and then pursue a PhD, because in Kenya, it is very competitive.\n00:04:33 Collins\nInteresting. Interesting.\n00:04:36 Collins\nI really wish you well in your current and future endeavors.\n00:04:40 Collins\nDo you have any short-term goals or steps that you’re working on to move you toward that desired career?\n00:04:49 Denis\nSorry?\n00:04:53 Collins\nIf you have any short-term goals or steps that you’re working on to move you toward your desired career.\n\n00:04:55 Collins\nIf you have any short-term goals or steps that you're working on to move you toward your desired career.\n00:05:05 Denis\nSome goals.\n00:05:06 Collins\nYes, yes.\n00:05:10 Denis\nOK, with this one.\n00:05:19 Denis\nOK.\n00:05:22 Denis\nSo short-term goals.\n00:05:25 Denis\nLike, you know, as I'm studying law, there are various things that I have to do.\n00:05:28 Denis\nFor example, the one that is called CPM. Of course, assistant or in Kenya's judicial system, they are trying to encourage what is called ADR and this ADR...\n00:05:33 Denis\nLet me know.\n00:05:41 Denis\n...is where disputes or cases are not in the court. So...\n00:05:49 Denis\nWithin a short goal, I want to be...\n00:05:53 Denis\n...CPM.\n00:05:53 Denis\nThat is, a certified professional mediator.\n00:05:59 Denis\nWhich the courts cannot fail to practice or to help in solving such disputes outside the court.\n00:06:08 Collins\nOK.\n00:06:11 Collins\nWell, that's interesting, and...\n00:06:11 Collins\nYeah.\n00:06:14 Collins\nHave your goals changed over time?\n00:06:16 Collins\nOr have you always been focused on these set goals?\n00:06:25 Denis\nI'm sorry, I didn't get you well.\n00:06:27 Collins\nYeah, I'm wondering if these goals will change over time or if you've always been focused on this career path.\n00:06:40 Denis\nOK. The question is, is it before...?\n00:06:44 Denis\n...or now, like before I joined university...?\n00:06:47 Denis\n...or as I am continuing with this career? Because in Form 1...\n00:06:54 Collins\nWe may talk about before you picked on...\n00:06:57 Collins\n...you settled on law as a profession or career.\n00:07:04 Denis\nThanks.\n00:07:04 Denis\nObviously, at first, I didn't want to do this because when I was learning in Form 1...\n00:07:12 Denis\n...of course, law was one of the careers that I chose, but I didn't major in it.\n00:07:19 Collins\nOK.\n00:07:19 Denis\nBut when things went W...\n00:07:22 Denis\n...repl.\n00:07:23 Collins\nNo, I can hear him.\n00:07:25 Denis\nSo...\n00:07:28 Denis\n...should I continue?\n00:07:29 Collins\nPlease, continue.\n00:07:32 Denis\nOK, when things went worse—what do they say? South.\n00:07:37 Denis\nObviously.\n00:07:41 Denis\nI considered medicine and surgery, but unfortunately, I couldn't make it.\n00:07:48 Denis\nBy Form 2, I got...\n00:07:50 Denis\n...and by Form 3, I just settled for law.\n00:07:53 Denis\nAnd from then, I've never changed my mind.\n00:07:56 Denis\nWell.\n00:07:56 Collins\nWow, that's so intriguing.\n00:07:57 Collins\nInteresting, Denis. I'd like to now understand the reasons why you decided to pick law, because now you mentioned in Form 1 you had something else, in Form 2 you had another thing, and by Form 3, you also had another.\n00:08:13 Collins\nNow I'm interested in knowing the motivations and influences...\n00:08:20 Collins\n...that led you to pursue law as a career.\n00:08:23 Collins\nSo what really inspired you to choose?\n00:08:27 Collins\nIncluding food and...?\n00:08:29 Collins\nWas it really a passion or maybe an experience or just sort of...?\n00:08:40 Denis\nOK.\n00:08:41 Denis\nYou know, law...\n00:08:42 Denis\n...is something that is very vast.\n00:08:45 Denis\nYou can decide to practice law, and obviously, law...\n00:08:51 Denis\n...has various specializations.\n00:08:53 Denis\nThere are criminal lawyers, corporate lawyers, and such like things.\n00:08:59 Denis\nAnd also, you can just...\n00:09:03 Denis\n...become a lecturer, or also, you can just...\n00:09:08 Denis\n...decide to...\n00:09:12 Denis\nYeah, you can just become a lecturer, of course.\n00:09:15 Denis\nAnd so, you know, you are exposed, and that’s why in Kenya, most of the politicians, most of them who have succeeded, did law. And when you are doing law, you are exposed to such people who are in a position...\n00:09:31 Denis\n...of attaining such goals as a law student. Of course, when you come from...\n00:09:40 Denis\n...the background that you come from doesn’t matter as such, so long as you have your mind set to meet such goals.\n00:09:51 Denis\nAnd also, what would validate me is that, as long as you know, lawyers are...\n00:09:59 Denis\n...a poor lawyer shouldn’t...\n00:10:00 Collins\nWhy? Why? Why?\n00:10:05 Denis\nYou know, lawyers are never poor. For example, you know, just if you have a case and you appear in court, of course the fee for justice is at least...\n00:10:27 Denis\n...at least 5000, of course, just appearing and leaving the rest.\n00:10:32 Denis\nYou can just decide and just prepare a piece of paper, one page, or you can print it for 100.\n00:10:36 Denis\nAnd, of course, when you are in such a career...\n00:10:45 Denis\n...there are various opportunities that you have, and when you explore them, it is very hard for you to become poor.\n00:10:51 Denis\nChanging my background or my home background is one of the things that motivated me to take this career path.\n00:10:59 Collins\nWell, that’s so interesting.\n00:11:01 Collins\nI really wish you all the best in your aspirations.\n00:11:07 Collins\nWhen you were doing this, I’m wondering if there are people in your life, such as your family, friends, or even mentors, who have worked in a similar field.\n00:11:21 Denis\nActually, my close...\n00:11:23 Denis\n...let’s say nuclear family.\n00:11:27 Denis\nTo be honest, I think there’s no one who has taken such a career path. In fact, the highest level anyone has gone is a primary school teacher. So, of course...\n00:11:41 Denis\n...my siblings or parents are not in such career paths. I think that didn’t have any influence on my...\n00:11:53 Collins\nOK.\n00:11:56 Denis\nYeah.\n00:11:57 Collins\nAlright. And have you ever experienced or encountered any role models or maybe stories that have just shaped your aspirations in this space?\n00:12:09\nThank you.\n00:12:13 Denis\nYes, of course. They have to be stories...\n00:12:17 Denis\n...that motivate you.\n00:12:20 Denis\nYou know the famous writer? Of course, he didn’t take the path of law, but actually, no, the famous rule—the best neurosurgeon by then—that is Ben Carson.\n00:12:36 Denis\nActually, he was from a very poor background, and before then he was...\n00:12:42 Denis\n...a student or a child who was very low or was a slacker.\n00:12:48 Denis\nHe was very poor in matters of studies, but due to the motivation of the parents who were very poor, I think this man...\n00:12:57 Denis\n...actually ended up being one of the best neurosurgeons that ever existed in the globe.\n00:13:06 Denis\nSo, of course, in Kenya, there are various people...\n00:13:10 Denis\n...like you can be proud of, though their background, I don’t know as such, but...\n00:13:17 Denis\n...actually, in their practice, they have risen to be very powerful lawyers.\n00:13:22 Denis\nVery famous people.\n00:13:24 Denis\nPeople like James Sorengo and...\n00:13:28 Denis\n...yeah, and Maraga, who once told us about his story and his struggles, and such people...\n00:13:37 Denis\nUh, I think...\n00:13:37 Denis\n...uh, they have this far actually motivated me to continue aspiring even for more.\n00:13:48 Collins\nSounds so interesting.\n00:13:51 Collins\nSounds so interesting. The game is on.\n00:13:55 Collins\nI’m just wondering if you had any sources of information that you rely on to help you make decisions around your career choices or with something you want to talk about.\n00:14:08 Collins\nYou see?\n00:14:08 Collins\nThe guidance from your school counselors or the Internet, or even the sources that motivated you to get into the career that you chose?\n00:14:22 Denis\nOK, this career path I chose...\n00:14:29 Denis\nActually, I can’t say that there was any source that motivated me to take this career.\n00:14:38 Denis\nBut I can say it was just something...\n00:14:41 Denis\n...internal that made me do so.\n00:14:46 Denis\nAnd you can do this, meaning that you can remember in high school...\n00:14:50 Denis\n...of course, we were doing Humanities...\n00:14:54 Denis\n...and what happened to be one of the subjects that I used to perform better? And that’s also in languages. So we do this...\n00:15:01 Denis\nI think they motivated me because these are the requirements that if you have, actually, you can do well in such a career path.\n00:15:08 Denis\nSo that’s why I chose this career path. But having any information...\n00:15:12 Denis\n...from other people, of course, I can say nay.\n00:15:15 Collins\nOK.\n00:15:18 Denis\nYeah.\n00:15:18 Collins\nThank you for that response, and onto my last question, which is...\n00:15:25 Collins\n...if you had challenges or opportunities in making your decision, because of course, you realize that maybe when you perform well after high school, you may have...\n00:15:37 Collins\n...a couple of options that you may want to take on. Let’s say you’re thinking about getting into...\n00:15:43 Collins\n...maybe, maybe, say you were thinking about becoming a...\n00:15:47 Collins\n...thinking about becoming a lawyer, rather than a teacher, you know, so...\n00:15:53 Collins\nIf you experienced any challenge or entertained thoughts when coming up with this decision?\n00:16:02 Denis\nOK, you know...\n00:16:06 Denis\n...as a student who is studying in a third-world country or a country like Kenya, there have to be various challenges that you encounter.\n00:16:16 Denis\nIn your academic journey, and with me...\n00:16:20 Denis\n...I can say there have been financial challenges with this, but you know, comparing law to other courses, like medicine, also...\n00:16:32 Denis\n...I can say law is a bit cheaper because law...\n00:16:37 Denis\n...as of now...\n00:16:39 Denis\n...the total school fee that we are paying is around 183,600, as compared to medical-related courses. Of course, you are paying which...\n00:16:50 Denis\n...I wish we share costs a lot to do, because for example, in my university, like, you can take, for example, medicine, which costs over 600K, so...\n00:16:56 Denis\nMatters financial challenges, or as you compare law to other courses, I think law is relatively cheaper, though such challenges have...\n00:17:16 Collins\nYeah.\n00:17:17 Collins\nYeah.\n00:17:18 Collins\nYeah, that’s so interesting.\n00:17:20 Collins\nYeah. And thank you for sharing that.\n00:17:25 Collins\nSo, Denis, you’ve come to the end of the questions, and I want to thank you so much for sharing your thoughts.\n00:17:34 Collins\nYour interests and...\n00:17:37 Collins\n...the purpose for this research?\n00:17:40 Collins\nAnd I just want to thank you once again for...\n00:17:41 Denis\nGoodnight.\n\n"

And maybe how they've influenced your current educational path, which is the course that you’re currently enrolled in?\n00:01:54 Innocent\nIn...\n00:02:01 Innocent\nI can say that my high school, Kangaroo School, has the most influence on the career I took.\n00:02:08 Innocent\nAnd...\n00:02:10 Innocent\nThe influence involves around the... I can say the grade that I got that first...\n00:02:19 Innocent\nMy overall performance in high school.\n00:02:23 Innocent\nAnd it allowed me to achieve this... this kind of course.\n00:02:29 Collins\nOK.\n00:02:29 Collins\nSo it's basically your...\n00:02:30 Innocent\nAnd also... yeah, motivation from my peers telling me, \"You can do this.\"\n00:02:43 Collins\nOK, interesting. Now let's talk about your future and, in your future, basically about your career aspirations.\n00:02:55 Collins\nWhat are your long-term career goals or the kind of work that you envision yourself doing after graduation?\n00:03:04 Innocent\nUh...\n00:03:06 Innocent\nAfter... for now I can say that I'm focusing on completing my undergraduate.\n00:03:13 Innocent\nBut after...\n00:03:16 Innocent\nAfter completing my undergraduate, I just need some time to work.\n00:03:25 Innocent\nProbably like a span of five years.\n00:03:31 Innocent\nThen I can see if I'm eligible for postgraduate, I'll join, though I'm not sure which one I'll join.\n00:03:41 Collins\nOK.\n00:03:43 Collins\nSo, it's basically working just around your...\n00:03:43\nYeah.\n00:03:50 Collins\nI mean, around your field of study, because you say you're studying medicine, and in most occasions, those who study medicine are definitely going to be medical doctors, right?\n00:04:00 Collins\nSo do you mean you want to start working in a hospital environment, or do you want to create opportunities for yourself? Or...\n00:04:12 Collins\nCould you just maybe talk about that?\n00:04:15 Innocent\nOK, if I could have an opportunity to create other opportunities or to venture in other areas...\n00:04:26 Innocent\nIt would still be...\n00:04:27 Innocent\nIt would still be matters around the hospital.\n00:04:30 Innocent\nSo even if I eventually take...\n00:04:32 Collins\nIt will be...\n00:04:34 Innocent\nAdventure in tech Med.\n00:04:38 Innocent\nYeah. So...\n00:04:40 Innocent\nI'm aspiring also to be a tech...\n00:04:44 Innocent\nAnd I just want to relate it with the medical career.\n00:04:51 Collins\nInteresting. Innocent.\n00:04:54 Collins\nThat's so...\n00:04:54 Collins\nI think a combination of tech and medicine could be a really good combination and there could be much around that.\n00:05:04 Collins\nSo let me just...\n\n00:05:07 Collins\nUnderstand if you have any short-term goals or steps that you're working on to move toward your desired career, which you mentioned is being a medical doctor.\n00:05:16\nWorked.\n00:05:17\nThank you.\n00:05:24 Innocent\nThe steps I have is...\n00:05:29 Innocent\nMust leave.\n00:05:30 Innocent\nI can say that...\n00:05:31 Innocent\nUh, my own passion drives me.\n00:05:38 Innocent\nAnother thing I can say is that I have friends.\n00:05:43 Innocent\nI have people around me who motivate me.\n00:05:45 Innocent\nThey tell me, \"You can do this.\"\n00:05:46 Innocent\nThose are some of the things that keep me going, and also the facilities by the school are also good.\n00:05:52\nWe...\n00:05:53 Innocent\nAnd they also enable one to become a good one.\n00:05:56 Collins\nOK.\n00:05:58 Innocent\nYeah.\n00:05:59 Collins\nAll right.\n00:06:01 Collins\nThat’s all great. I’m glad to hear that there are some steps that led you to your desired career.\n00:06:14 Collins\nAre these goals that you've had? Now, do you want to move into MedTech, something associated with MedTech? Have your goals changed over time, or have you always been focused on the same path?\n00:06:30 Innocent\nTo be honest,\n00:06:31 Innocent\nBefore I chose my medical career,\n00:06:36 Innocent\nI had so many options.\n00:06:39 Innocent\nSo... but...\n00:06:43 Innocent\nFor... just to be convenient...\n00:06:46 Innocent\nYou guys cannot take command and another course, so I had to choose one.\n00:06:50 Collins\nYes, yes.\n00:06:51 Innocent\nSo I ever wanted to venture into tech...\n00:06:55\nMm.\n00:06:57 Innocent\nAnd maybe architecture...\n00:07:01 Innocent\nBut you know, I had to choose one, so I went for Med, but I had some other...\n00:07:07 Collins\nAs an option.\n00:07:10 Innocent\nYeah.\n00:07:11 Collins\nOK, so...\n00:07:13 Collins\nYour short-term goals still remain. I mean, you still align your focus towards these short-term goals, right?\n00:07:24 Innocent\nYeah. I’m learning to take.\n00:07:29 Collins\nOK, OK, great. Now I'd like to understand the reasons behind your career choices.\n00:07:36 Collins\nLike, let’s talk about your motivations and...\n00:07:40 Collins\nSo what really inspired you to choose your current field of study?\n00:07:44 Collins\nOr your current career path. Was it really a passion?\n00:07:47 Collins\nA specific experience or other factors led to you choosing the field of medicine?\n00:07:59 Innocent\nWhen I... when I was young...\n00:08:05 Innocent\nI had the passion...\n00:08:07 Innocent\nI started having the passion... there were some doctors who visited us.\n00:08:12 Innocent\nAnd, you know, it was very nice interacting with them.\n00:08:15 Innocent\nSo, you know, you are young and when they come, they...\n00:08:20 Innocent\nThe excitement that when you're young, you really also want to do this.\n00:08:23 Collins\nYeah.\n00:08:26 Innocent\nAnd then now later in high school, you realize that you have the potential and you can do this.\n00:08:32 Innocent\nSo that really inspired me to do this.\n00:08:36 Collins\nOK, great.\n00:08:39 Collins\nSo are there people in your life...\n00:08:42 Collins\nLet’s talk about your family, your friends, your mentors who have worked in a similar field, and if so, have they influenced your decisions?\n00:08:53 Innocent\nYes, there...\n00:08:54 Innocent\nThere are some family members, though not in the same exact house, but, you know, courses like nursing courses, like clinical medicine. There are very many people around me...\n00:09:04 Innocent\nDid that.\n00:09:05 Innocent\nSo they also influenced me, like, “Go for the bigger one.”\n00:09:09 Collins\nOK.\n00:09:11\nYeah.\n00:09:12 Collins\nOK, great.\n00:09:16 Collins\nNow, almost to the last questions, I’d love to know if you’ve encountered any role models in the fields of medicine or other stories that have shaped your aspirations in the space.\n00:09:32 Innocent\nPardon the question, please.\n00:09:34 Collins\nI’d love to know if you’ve encountered any role models or stories that have shaped your aspirations in this space that you’re currently studying.\n00:09:47\nRepl.\n00:09:48 Innocent\nOh, talking about role models?\n00:09:55 Innocent\nI... I have to say that I'm really inspired by some people, some...\n00:09:58 Innocent\nGood doctors.\n00:10:00 Collins\nOK. Could you mention?\n00:10:01 Innocent\nHow the shock?\n00:10:05 Innocent\nI will mention...\n00:10:06 Innocent\nOne of our lecturers, who really inspired me.\n00:10:11\nNone.\n00:10:13 Innocent\nOne of our lecturers, when I was a first-year, she was called Doctor, but...\n00:10:18 Collins\nOK.\n00:10:20 Innocent\nAnd she used to have personal sessions with us.\n00:10:23 Innocent\nWe were in a group under her.\n00:10:26 Innocent\nAnd she really taught us a lot and told us to work hard, never to give up.\n00:10:35 Innocent\nWhen we were just in today. So I think Linda, that really encouraged me because I still have a long way to go.\n00:10:41 Collins\nYeah, that’s so interesting to hear.\n00:10:45 Collins\nWhat other sources of information have helped you to make decisions around your career choice?\n00:10:52 Collins\nYou know, for example, have you relied on guidance and counselling from school counselors, your family?\n00:11:00 Collins\nThe internet, or any other sources?\n00:11:06 Innocent\nUh...\n00:11:09 Innocent\nI really rely on the matters around scoring.\n00:11:14 Innocent\nNot really family.\n00:11:19 Innocent\nThe information from the school or information from peers.\n00:11:26 Innocent\nFrom senior students.\n00:11:27 Innocent\nInformation from senior lecturers, consultants.\n00:11:32\nYeah.\n00:11:34 Innocent\nSo that really changes my perspective about it and...\n00:11:39 Collins\nInteresting. Interesting.\n00:11:42 Collins\nNow, under the last section, which is really on the decision-making process.\n00:11:49 Collins\nHave you faced any challenges or uncertainties when making these decisions? Because you talk about having options like medicine and architecture.\n00:12:01 Collins\nSo maybe there was that...\n00:12:04 Collins\nYou’re not sure whether this is the course that I’m supposed to really be, or if I should really go for this one.\n00:12:10 Collins\nAnd if yes, if yes, there was that uncertainty, how did you get to overcome?\n00:12:20 Innocent\nThe way I got to overcome the uncertainty...\n00:12:24 Innocent\nIs by, I think, doing some research, going to the internet and reviewing those courses, also getting information from, you know, the... like...\n00:12:35 Innocent\nTold you that I have relatives who are nurses, clinical medicine.\n00:12:39 Collins\nYes, yes.\n00:12:39 Innocent\nSo I also get info from them because they interact with the doctors.\n00:12:46 Innocent\nSo that really influenced me because I can say that...\n00:12:52 Innocent\nThe architects around me, you know, they are not much, but the nurses were overwhelming.\n00:12:57 Innocent\nIt really influenced my decision to the other side.\n00:13:01 Collins\nInteresting all.\n00:13:03 Collins\nSo thank you so much, Innocent, for your time.\n00:13:07 Collins\nActually, that is the end of my questions, and your insights are incredibly valuable.\n00:13:16 Collins\nI really appreciate the time you’ve taken.\n00:13:19 Collins\nWithin your tight schedule, I know you’re preparing for exams at the moment.\n\n\n"

You understand the care, aspirations, and motivations of African students.\n00:00:22 Javan\nYes.\n00:00:23 Collins\nSo your responses will be kept confidential and not only for the survey purposes.\n00:00:30 Javan\nNo problem.\n00:00:32 Collins\nThe session is supposed to take about approximately 10 minutes, and I'll be asking you some questions about your studies, your career goals, and motivations behind your choices.\n00:00:45 Javan\nYes.\n00:00:50 Javan\nOK.\n00:00:51 Collins\nYes, so please...\n00:00:51 Collins\nYou need to answer as openly as you're comfortable with.\n00:00:54 Collins\nAnd yeah.\n00:00:56 Javan\nThank you.\n00:00:59 Javan\nWhen I'm ready.\n00:01:01 Collins\nSo let's start with a little introduction about...\n00:01:06 Collins\nBasically your educational background.\n00:01:10 Javan\nOK. Hello once more.\n00:01:12 Javan\nI'm Javan.\n00:01:16 Javan\nI am at the University of Nairobi, currently pursuing electrical and electronics engineering.\n00:01:23 Javan\nPrior to that, I was at Kanga High School.\n00:01:27 Javan\nFrom Form 1 to Form 4, and before that, I was in Carnival Catholic Primary School, which is in Nairobi. And yeah, along the way, I've learned quite a lot.\n00:01:41 Javan\nA lot.\n00:01:42 Javan\nAnd I'm looking forward.\n00:01:45 Collins\nThank you so much.\n00:01:48 Collins\nThank you for that elaborate introduction.\n00:01:51 Collins\nAnd it has basically answered... it's been so comprehensive that it has basically answered my second question, which...\n00:02:00 Collins\nWas about the institutions rather than schools that you attended before college or university, which you mentioned Kanga High School. You also mentioned...\n00:02:10 Collins\nWhich is very good now.\n00:02:13 Collins\nThere's just the other part, or rather the portion of the question, which...\n00:02:18 Collins\nReally is to just to know how these institutions that you've attended before campus...\n00:02:24 Collins\nActually influenced your educational path.\n00:02:31 Javan\nOK, what I can say currently is... I'm an engineering student, and I think...\n00:02:41 Javan\nThat is a...\n00:02:44 Javan\nA lot of... I can credit a lot of it to Kanga High School, where I got to meet the different types of professionals.\n00:02:53 Javan\nThat is due to the Kanga Association, which exposed me to such professionals, and I could see and hear about the engineers and they could talk a little bit about their life. And yeah, I felt motivated.\n00:03:11 Javan\nIt fascinated me being an engineer.\n00:03:14 Javan\nYeah. So most of the credit I can give to Kanga High.\n00:03:18 Javan\nBut as well as Carnival, not much since I was just a kid. Maybe I can say it just enabled me to see that I was good at math.\n00:03:24 Javan\nQuestion.\n00:03:30 Collins\nNow let's talk about your future job.\n00:03:32 Collins\nI'd love to know your career aspiration.\n00:03:36 Collins\nWhat are your long-term career goals and the kind of work that you envision yourself doing after you graduate from the University of Nairobi?\n00:03:45 Javan\nI really do have a strong passion for engineering, so I hope and pray that in future I may get in touch with the real engineering staff and...\n00:03:59 Javan\nHelp to pioneer some great innovations in the world, most majorly in the technological aspect in the tech world, as we know we are in the age where technology is growing really, really fast.\n00:04:12 Javan\nI want to be part of that wave of technological advancement.\n00:04:17 Javan\nAnd...\n00:04:19 Javan\nAs well as I don't want to be just a manager, so as much as being technical in the engineering area, I'd also love to be a manager and learn how to deal with people and such...\n00:04:35 Javan\n...of stuff.\n00:04:38 Collins\nI'm wishing you all the best. That's interesting, and...\n00:04:44 Collins\nI just wish you well in your aspirations. If you have any short-term goals or steps that you're working on to move towards your desired career.\n00:05:00 Javan\nFirstly, of course, to achieve that, I need to excel in my...\n00:05:05 Javan\nSo that's the primary goal, to excel first class, second class upper.\n00:05:12 Javan\nBut excel...\n00:05:12 Javan\nWell, so that I can achieve some great scholarships and further my studies so that I can make it to that goal of mine.\n00:05:28 Collins\nRight. That sounds so good.\n00:05:31 Collins\nGetting a first class or a second class upper is something that is very, very possible.\n00:05:41 Collins\nSo I really want to know if these goals have changed over time, or if you've always been focused on this path.\n00:05:56 Javan\nIf there is a change, I can't say it's much, it's quite negligible since...\n00:06:02 Javan\nAll along, I've...\n00:06:03 Javan\nI've known what I want to do, so...\n00:06:06 Javan\nMaybe due to the exposure that I've had over the past few months or years that I've been out here...\n00:06:15 Javan\nThey might have changed a little bit.\n00:06:17 Javan\nI've refined them more, but not towards the negative or automatic... towards the positive for the betterment...\n00:06:25 Javan\nOf that process.\n\n00:06:26\nOK.\n00:06:29 Collins\nWell, that's that's that's that's interesting.\n00:06:32 Collins\nI'd like to understand the reasons behind your career choice which you mentioned is engineering. Basically specifically electrical engineering, yeah.\n00:06:45 Collins\nSo what?\n00:06:45 Javan\nYeah.\n00:06:46 Collins\nWhat really inspired you to choose these fields of study? And I'm interested to know if this was really a passion or a specific experience for just other factors.\n00:07:03 Javan\nThe lexical.\n00:07:05 Javan\nWell, I can say this.\n00:07:08 Javan\nWhile choosing, I knew I wanted to be an.\n00:07:11 Javan\nBut I didn't know specifically electrical engineering. I've come to love the field.\n00:07:17 Javan\nAs I am studying it right now, I've come to love the realm of electrical.\n00:07:23 Javan\nBut initially, I can only sustain that. I wasn't sure which one specifically, but in general engineering I have I.\n00:07:32 Javan\nI can say it was a passion since childhood, since I really loved the innovation, the technical aspect of it, and.\n00:07:42 Javan\nThe mathematics and all that.\n00:07:44 Javan\nYeah. Then those are some of the things.\n00:07:47 Javan\nI.\n00:07:48 Javan\nSee the life of some great engineers, those who made it, and I could.\n00:07:53 Javan\nI couldn't my. So that's together with.\n00:07:57 Javan\nThe fact that the.\n00:08:00 Javan\nMotivated me, driving me to choose this course.\n00:08:06\nYes.\n00:08:08 Collins\nWell, that's that's that's cool. Sounds very.\n00:08:13 Collins\nReal. I'm interested to know if there are people in your life, maybe your family, your friends, or mentors who have actually worked in this similar field and if so.\n00:08:25 Collins\nHow have they influenced your decisions?\n00:08:32 Javan\nYeah, I have a feeling that is more work.\n00:08:37 Javan\nNot in electrical engineering per se, but.\n00:08:41 Javan\nIn engineering generally.\n00:08:45 Javan\nAnd we have, we don't.\n00:08:46 Javan\nWe don't really talk that much, but during the time of choosing the career, they really motivated me.\n00:08:55 Javan\nYeah, they told me the real things about what to expect in engineering.\n00:09:01 Javan\nAlright, through Disneyland. And they told me the troubles and.\n00:09:07 Javan\nAnd what to expect in general?\n00:09:09 Javan\nReality of.\n00:09:10 Javan\nSo I can say they gave me.\n00:09:14 Javan\nQuite, quite, quite.\n00:09:15 Javan\nTalk before, before, before making the choice.\n00:09:20 Collins\nAlright.\n00:09:23 Collins\nThank you so much for sharing that.\n00:09:25 Collins\nJavan, you mentioned relatives in the build.\n00:09:30 Collins\nAnd now these people are in some way giving you advice, you know, which is very.\n00:09:38 Collins\nUnnecessary, I'd say for someone graduating directly from high school now.\n00:09:45 Collins\nThere's that role of role models. There's that role that they play in.\n00:09:51 Collins\nAnd maybe shaping your inspiration or I'd say.\n00:09:58 Collins\nYou know, there are also stories out there that may help you.\n00:10:04 Collins\nShape your aspirations in the field that you are in.\n00:10:07 Collins\nCould you?\n00:10:08 Collins\nWould you? Would you like to talk about that?\n00:10:13 Javan\n****. **** question.\n00:10:18 Collins\nJust interested in knowing if you.\n00:10:22 Collins\nMaybe encountered or interacted with role models or other stories that may have shaped your aspirations in the space of engineering?\n00:10:35 Javan\nYeah, yeah, I.\n00:10:37 Javan\nI can mention one incident to high school where one of the Conga Old Boys Association, one of them came by and.\n00:10:51 Javan\nDuring those functions, Coba and they used to.\n00:10:56 Javan\nAnd then he used to talk a lot. And yeah, share some of his life stories, but.\n00:11:05 Javan\nI just saw him and I felt like this is what I want. So.\n00:11:10 Collins\nYeah.\n00:11:12 Javan\nI feel this is the life I want, and that’s that’s to me was very.\n00:11:17 Javan\nA major driving factor? A major one.\n00:11:21 Javan\nThat’s the one I can point out.\n00:11:24 Collins\nAnd do you rely on any?\n00:11:27 Collins\nI mean, did you rely on any sources of information that maybe helped you make these decisions around a career choice for, for instance, maybe?\n00:11:37 Collins\nGuidance from your school counselors, maybe your family, the Internet, or any other sources.\n00:11:46 Javan\nYeah. Yeah, I convention too.\n00:11:48 Javan\nFirstly, the Internet really helped me.\n00:11:51 Javan\nI did a lot.\n00:11:53 Javan\nI did a lot of research over the Internet to look at the engineering and everything surrounding engineering.\n00:12:02 Javan\nThen finally, yes, my dad really helped me, exposed me to some of his coworkers who are engineers, electrical.\n00:12:11 Javan\nAnd that lady really, really taught me a lot about electrical engineering and engineering in general and yeah, how to program. Maneuver your way through the.\n00:12:23\nPop.\n00:12:24 Collins\nSounds so inspirational.\n00:12:29 Collins\nNow to our last question. Have you faced any uncertainties or challenges when making career decisions?\n00:12:42 Javan\nOh.\n00:12:43 Javan\nOh yes, that is. Yeah, yeah.\n00:12:49 Javan\nMaking the decision, I had a lot of.\n00:12:51 Javan\nQuestions because I was weighing between medicine and engineering, and it was quite a battle.\n00:12:59 Javan\nIt was quite a battle, but I can.\n00:13:02 Javan\nOn.\n00:13:02 Javan\nI chose 1 and I’m really contented with it.\n00:13:07 Collins\nSo how? How did you come to overcome these challenges?\n00:13:14\nRepl.\n00:13:15 Javan\nMajorly I’d advise someone to really, really, really talk to experts, to people in the field.\n00:13:21 Javan\nTalking, if you're, for example, in my case I was weighing between medicine and engineering, I went out and looked for people in the field and.\n00:13:30 Javan\nThey told me the realities and everything, and through that I made my decision.\n00:13:38 Collins\nOK.\n00:13:39 Javan\nYeah.\n00:13:41 Collins\nThank you so much.\n00:13:43 Collins\nThank you for sharing your thoughts.\n00:13:47 Collins\nThe insights are incredibly valuable.\n00:13:48 Collins\nYou.\n00:13:52 Collins\nAnd I really appreciate the time you've taken to give me information about your aspirations and how you maneuvered through.\n\n"

So let's start with a little introduction about yourself.\n00:00:50 Collins\nYou may want to talk about educational.\n00:00:52 Collins\nCan you share what program or field of study you're currently pursuing in college?\n00:01:00 Jonas\nI'm gonna.\n00:01:03 Jonas\nAsk a student of mechanical and production engineering at more university. Yeah, OK.\n00:01:09 Collins\nThat's great to hear, Jonas.\n00:01:11 Collins\nCould you tell me about the schools or institutions that you've attended before college and how they've influenced your current educational path?\n00:01:22 Jonas\nYeah, I I took my camera because when I see that Academy, I'm gonna. I later went to attend high school, which is actually known for maths and sciences. I think that's actually what made me become an engineer because.\n00:01:37 Jonas\nIt was a school which was actually which, after the majored in maths and sciences.\n00:01:42 Jonas\nYeah, I think kinda is what made me become an engineer today.\n00:01:43\nThanks.\n00:01:46 Collins\nOK, great.\n00:01:47\nGreat.\n00:01:48 Collins\nNow let's talk about your future.\n00:01:50 Collins\nWhat are some of the long term career goals or the kind of work you envision yourself doing after graduation?\n00:01:58\nPardon.\n00:01:59 Collins\nWhat are your long term career goals or the kind of work that you envision yourself doing after graduating from more university?\n00:02:09 Jonas\nI think I've got the meeting at noon W day. I think. I don't think this will be the end of my my education first because I want to proceed to.\n00:02:20 Jonas\nDo my higher education. My father, father, my studies, I think.\n00:02:24 Jonas\nGood.\n00:02:26 Jonas\nNeed to improve in in the field of engineering, but I don't think.\n00:02:32 Jonas\nI have the goals first the career goals because after I went to studies abroad first, yeah.\n00:02:42 Collins\nThat's that's interesting.\n00:02:44 Collins\nDo you have any now?\n00:02:48 Collins\nHave these your goals or let me rather ask, do you have any short term goals?\n00:02:53 Collins\nYou're working on to help you move to where you envision yourself after graduation.\n00:03:00 Jonas\nWe admission myself for aggregation.\n00:03:04 Jonas\nI can come.\n00:03:05 Collins\nNot like like long short term goals. That or steps that you're working on to to move you towards that place where you're envisioning yourself after graduation?\n00:03:18 Jonas\nOK, I think after after graduating I think I want to see myself working in this field of engineering in the field of mechanical engineering, I think.\n00:03:29 Jonas\nI don't get your question very well.\n00:03:31 Collins\nLike if you have any short short term goals short term goals yeah. Because you mentioned that your long term goal you want to after moving from more university you want to go and further your studies abroad in the same field.\n00:03:41 Jonas\nTell me please.\n00:03:46 Collins\nI'm wondering if you have a short term goal.\n00:03:49 Collins\nOr steps that you're working on to help you get there.\n00:03:55 Jonas\nAt the at the moment I think what what I'm working on is achieving the grades here at my university. That would make me actually managed to go and study and study there because you come to go there with.\n00:04:09 Jonas\nI think for me to go outside abroad to go to masters abroad.\n00:04:12 Jonas\nA.\n00:04:13 Jonas\nA scholarship you have to 1st have a first class honors.\n00:04:17 Jonas\nSo I think what I'm looking for now is having the basics of the knowledge to allow me that first class on us.\n00:04:24 Jonas\nYeah, that's what I'm looking on at the moment.\n00:04:26 Collins\nWow, that that's so.\n00:04:28 Collins\nAnd I'm wondering if your goals.\n00:04:30 Collins\nI've ever changed overtime or you've always been focused on these same paths of engineering.\n00:04:42 Jonas\nI think before I wanted to become a lawyer.\n00:04:46\nUh.\n00:04:49 Jonas\nAfter some time I came and realised that I was good in sciences.\n00:04:54 Jonas\nOK, and mathematics?\n00:04:56 Jonas\nYeah. And that's why I change and take this this career path of becoming an engineer.\n00:05:04\nYeah. OK.\n00:05:05 Collins\nGreat. Thank you so much for that response.\n00:05:09 Collins\nNow I'd like to understand the reasons behind your career choices.\n00:05:14 Collins\n00:05:18 Collins\nWhat really inspired you to choose engineering as a career?\n00:05:20 Collins\nWas it a passion?\n00:05:21 Collins\nA specific experience or just other factors?\n00:05:25 Jonas\nI think I have a number of factors, but let me become an engineer and what I've really talked about is because the schools it was before was good in sciences and mathematics. And then the second factor was because I saw what engineers used to do out here, and I was really passionate about it.\n00:05:37 Jonas\nI saw... I'm not familiar with this, by the way, and I used to see what in the news were doing when they became.\n00:05:45 Jonas\nAnd I fell in love with what they were doing.\n00:05:49 Jonas\nThat's uh, I never...\n00:05:54 Jonas\nOK. Yeah.\n00:06:01 Collins\nThank you so much for sharing, Jonas.\n00:06:03 Collins\nIt's great to hear that your passion for engineering grew. Now, are there people in your life such as your family, friends, or mentors who have worked in the same field?\n00:06:15 Jonas\nI think my family... There's no person that I have a family friend who is an engineer, but he's not working in the field of mechanical engineering.\n00:06:25 Collins\nOK.\n00:06:28 Collins\nDid they influence your decisions to get into the field?\n00:06:38 Jonas\nI think they just shared with me something after I decided I want to become an engineer, but at the beginning, they didn't have a big impact in making this decision.\n00:06:51 Collins\nOK, OK.\n00:06:53 Collins\nAlright, so I'm wondering if you've encountered any role models or stories that have shaped your aspirations in the same space?\n00:07:06 Jonas\nI think at the moment, I will check that guy as my role model in this field.\n00:07:14 Jonas\nBecause I think he's the only engineer in my village.\n00:07:17 Jonas\nAn engineer in my community.\n00:07:20 Jonas\nYeah, I think he is now my role model.\n00:07:25 Collins\nYeah. OK. OK.\n00:07:27 Collins\nNow, what are some of the sources of information that you're using to make decisions around this choice? We have a couple of sources that you might have used. For instance, we may talk about guidance from school counselors, family, or even the Internet, or just any other sources. Could you mention where you've gathered this information?\n00:07:53 Jonas\nI think currently...\n00:07:57 Jonas\nThe director has...\n00:08:00 Jonas\nYouTube lectures, and also the Internet. There's a lot of information on the Internet, so sometimes I use the Internet as much as I can.\n00:08:12 Collins\nOK.\n00:08:14 Collins\nThank you so much for that.\n00:08:23 Collins\nGood response now.\n00:08:26 Collins\nTo our last question, I’ve actually heard you mention that you initially were interested in pursuing law. Or you wanted to be a lawyer, and I know after high school, students usually have many options and are always in a state of uncertainty, wondering which course is best for them.\n00:08:47 Collins\nConsidering you performed well, now where should you be going and what should you be doing?\n00:08:53 Collins\nSo I'm wondering, did you experience any challenges or uncertainties when making the decision to pursue engineering?\n00:09:01 Jonas\nI don’t think I’ve experienced any challenges so far because I think I applied for both law and engineering, and I was in this field of engineering.\n00:09:12 Jonas\nAnd I think that was an advantage to me because after high school, I decided I want to become an engineer.\n00:09:27 Jonas\nSo when I was...\n00:09:32 Collins\nGreat.\n00:09:33 Collins\nThat’s all great to hear, Jonas, and thank you so much for sharing your thoughts and insights into this research.\n00:09:42 Collins\nThey are very valuable to what I’m currently doing.\n\n"

So let's start with a little introduction about yourself, Killion. You may want to talk about your educational background.\n00:01:01 Killion\nThanks. Thank you.\n00:01:04 Killion\nMy name is Killion Jack Oliver.\n00:01:08 Killion\nCurrently second-year student at Kissimmee.\n00:01:13 Killion\nTaking a Bachelor of Science in software engineering.\n00:01:21 Killion\nI joined Kissy from Kanga High School with a good grade.\n00:01:29 Killion\nWhereas.\n00:01:33 Killion\nMy primary education, I acquired it from.\n00:01:37 Killion\nRongo primary school.\n00:01:39\nOK.\n00:01:40 Killion\nIs there anything else?\n00:01:44 Collins\nWell, thank you for highlighting the institutions that you've attended before joining Kiss University, Killion. So I'm just interested in knowing if these institutions that you've joined before, you mentioned Kanga High School. You've also mentioned Rongo primary school.\n00:02:03 Collins\nJust interested in knowing if any of these institutions have actually had an influence in your current educational path.\n00:02:16 Killion\nYeah, actually, it's both Rongo and Kanga school.\n00:02:20 Killion\nFirst of all.\n00:02:24 Killion\nRongo primary gave me a very good background which enabled me to survive through the high school life at Kanga High School. It gave me the...\n00:02:33 Killion\nLet me say, let me call it the foundation.\n00:02:45 Killion\nI should strive through high school.\n00:02:49 Killion\nOK. And secondly, Kanga school?\n00:02:51 Killion\nI learnt a lot there.\n00:02:55 Killion\nFrom friends, teachers and quite good teachers.\n00:02:58 Killion\nAnd I acquired a lot of good friends from there, which makes me think.\n00:03:07 Killion\nBoth the dear friends and teachers influenced me much, which enables me to pass my KCC exams.\n00:03:21 Collins\nWell.\n00:03:23\nYeah.\n00:03:23 Collins\nSo that's...\n00:03:25 Collins\nThat's all interesting to learn, Killion, about how the other institutions have actually influenced your current educational path and leading you to this university and now you're a sophomore as a software engineering student?\n00:03:43 Collins\nSo let's talk about your future, Killion.\n00:03:46 Collins\nI'm really interested in knowing your career aspirations.\n00:03:50 Collins\nSo you may want to talk about your long-term career goals or the kind of work you envision yourself doing after graduation.\n00:04:00 Killion\nAnd thank you so.\n00:04:01 Killion\nFirst of all.\n00:04:05 Killion\nMyself as a young boy.\n00:04:07 Killion\nI always liked to.\n00:04:09 Killion\nI always liked associating myself with technology.\n00:04:15 Killion\nBy technology, I mean much of computing.\n00:04:20 Killion\nI always felt very passionate about.\n00:04:25 Killion\nThe computing world.\n00:04:27 Killion\nWhich enabled me to make a decision when choosing my career path.\n00:04:33\nOK, OK.\n00:04:33 Killion\nAt Kanga school, I had a very good teacher.\n00:04:38\nIt...\n00:04:39 Killion\nOh.\n00:04:44 Killion\nYeah.\n00:04:45 Killion\nYeah.\n00:04:46 Collins\nSorry, Killion. I'm losing you. I think it's because of Internet.\n00:04:53 Collins\nWould you just want to maybe close your video?\n00:05:01 Collins\nHello, can you hear me?\n00:05:04 Killion\nI can hear you.\n00:05:07 Collins\nPlease go.\n00:05:08 Collins\nI just lost...\n00:05:09 Collins\nI think it's because of Internet connection issues.\n00:05:12 Killion\nYeah, I'm sorry.\n00:05:15 Killion\nSo as I was saying.\n00:05:18 Killion\nRight now at Kiss University, I feel quite confident.\n00:05:25 Killion\nThat at the end of my education at the institution,\n00:05:33 Killion\nI feel very confident that I will graduate with a very good degree if.\n00:05:40 Killion\nI don't think it can be and if not first class, that's my...\n00:05:46 Killion\nTag it and that's what I feel like I should achieve and.\n00:05:47 Collins\nWow.\n00:05:52 Killion\nAfter, yeah.\n00:05:55 Collins\nYeah, I'm just supporting what you're saying, really.\n00:05:59\n00:05:59 Killion\nSo.\n00:06:01 Killion\nAfter completing.\n00:06:04 Killion\nMy degree. That's when I think now the real life comes in, not school.\n00:06:11 Killion\nJust about some few practicals these days, but after campus.\n00:06:19 Killion\nI know it can be quite hard.\n00:06:23 Killion\nOr simple depending on the person.\n00:06:27 Killion\nWhich according to me.\n00:06:30 Killion\nFrom the knowledge I'm acquiring skills I'm acquiring from school, from friends, from the Internet.\n00:06:39 Killion\nI feel like I feel like and I know that it won't be such a very bad day.\n00:06:49 Killion\nReally difficult task to find myself a way to earn a living.\n00:06:54 Collins\nYeah, definitely.\n00:06:57 Killion\nYeah. So by that. Yeah, by that, what I'm trying to say is that.\n00:06:57 Collins\nWell, that's amazing.\n00:07:04 Killion\nMaybe, you know, in life you might graduate a degree in computing science and you end up somewhere, maybe doing something else.\n00:07:14 Killion\nWhich is not claimed yet degree.\n00:07:19\n00:07:20 Killion\nYes.\n00:07:23 Killion\nSo even myself.\n00:07:25 Killion\nTill now.\n00:07:32 Killion\nI’m not quite sure if I manage to get myself to secure myself.\n00:07:33 Killion\nNot a top-notch...\n00:07:44 Killion\nMm hmm, dealing with software. But you know, the field of computing sciences is quite...\n00:07:48 Killion\nAnd I believe I can find somewhere...\n00:07:51 Collins\nYes, yes.\n00:07:53 Collins\nOK, that's so great, Killion, and I wish you so well in your aspirations.\n00:07:54\nYeah.\n00:08:01 Collins\nDo you have any short-term goals or steps you're working on to move toward your desired career?\n00:08:02 Killion\nThank you so much.\n00:08:05 Collins\nDo you have any short-term goals or steps that you're working on to move toward your desired career?\n00:08:10 Killion\nYes, I have quite a lot of them. Because, first of all.\n00:08:21 Killion\nThe career I chose for myself.\n00:08:25 Killion\nRequires a lot of self-discipline.\n00:08:28 Collins\nYes.\n00:08:29 Killion\nAnd self-goals.\n00:08:31 Killion\nSo one of my goals is that.\n00:08:35 Killion\nIn order to get a chance in the market in the future.\n00:08:45 Killion\nI must acquire the required skills and by the required skills, it doesn't mean that.\n00:08:51 Killion\nThe normal skills I get from class or the few lectures, but I end up.\n00:09:02 Killion\nTrying to normal.\n00:09:05 Killion\nAbout the career path I chose.\n00:09:09 - Collins\nSecondly.\n00:09:14 - Collins\nMy goal is.\n00:09:18 - Collins\nLike.\n00:09:23 - Collins\nLet's say you know in software engineering, in order for you to become a software engineer, you must have some specific.\n00:09:34 - Collins\nLanguages you must know you can't manage to do all of them.\n00:09:40 - Collins\nSo myself, I've set my goal that by the end of my second year studies, I would have acquired the necessary skills required.\n00:09:51 - Collins\nTo perform well or.\n00:09:54 - Collins\nProgram using Java and Python.\n00:09:59 - Collins\nOK.\n00:10:02 - Collins\nThat's another one. Another goal of mine, I think those.\n00:10:08 - Collins\nAre the basic ones.\n00:10:11 - Collins\nUnless you want detailed.\n00:10:12 - Killion\nNo, I think that just mentions.\n00:10:17 - Killion\nIt in a better way really.\n00:10:20 - Killion\nJust to maybe follow up if these goals have changed over time or if you've always been focused on this path of software engineering or tech.\n00:10:36 - Collins\nAny paddle please?\n00:10:38 - Killion\nI'm wondering if.\n00:10:41 - Killion\nThese your goals have changed overtime, or if you've always been focused on this same path of software engineering or technology.\n00:10:45 - Collins\nYeah.\n00:10:54 - Collins\nYeah, actually at the time, I always had the desire to engage myself in business.\n00:11:05 - Collins\nAnd like I see the.\n00:11:07 - Collins\nIn the world, many people.\n00:11:09 - Collins\nPeople are currently involved in businesses opening large businesses in different towns, and I see them quite successfully, so sometimes it becomes a challenge like I see.\n00:11:24 - Collins\nMaybe the path I'm taking might be very long, yet I can.\n00:11:30 - Collins\nStart myself some business and prosper in life.\n00:11:33 - Collins\nBut that doesn't hinder me from continuing my.\n00:11:38 - Collins\nCareer.\n00:11:40 - Collins\nIt is something I really feel like I need to achieve.\n00:11:45 - Collins\nYes, yes.\n00:11:48 - Killion\nWell, that's so great to hear, Kilian.\n00:11:52 - Killion\nWell, I'd like to understand the reasons why you settled on software.\n00:11:57 - Killion\nMaybe your motivations and influences, what really inspired you to choose your current field of study?\n00:12:05 - Killion\nOr career.\n00:12:05 - Killion\nWas it just a passion?\n00:12:07 - Killion\nA specific experience or other factors?\n00:12:13 - Collins\nAnd so, first of all, my inspiration at first before I chose this path was.\n00:12:23 - Collins\nI had this curiosity of knowing how.\n00:12:27 - Collins\nThe programs we use in our phones, in our computers, how they work, that's something that.\n00:12:35 - Collins\nKept me wondering, how do these things work so?\n00:12:40 - Collins\nThrough a few friends of mine.\n00:12:43 - Collins\nAnd some of my seniors, I got to know, I got to know that it's all about programming and.\n00:12:52 - Collins\nThat that's what has been pushing me. Like I really need to understand.\n00:12:59 - Collins\nOK.\n00:13:00 - Collins\nOh, these things work out.\n00:13:03 - Killion\nSo it was somewhat curiosity which drove.\n00:13:10 - Killion\nWhich?\n00:13:10 - Collins\nYeah.\n00:13:11 - Killion\nWhich actually drove you to that, should I say passion or something into tech, yeah.\n00:13:18 - Collins\nYeah, it came from curiosity to passion.\n00:13:22 - Collins\nI became so passionate about.\n00:13:25 - Collins\nSoftware engineering.\n00:13:27 - Killion\nYeah, correct.\n00:13:27 - Collins\nGreat.\n00:13:29 - Killion\nSo are there people in your life? Let's talk about maybe your family, some friends or maybe mentors who have worked in a similar field of tech.\n00:13:40 - Killion\nAnd if so, have they influenced your decisions?\n00:13:47 - Collins\nYeah.\n00:13:50 - Collins\nIn my family, I think not that I think I'm the actually, I'm actually the first one to explore the world of tech.\n00:14:01 - Collins\nBut when it comes to friends, I have quite a number of friends.\n00:14:08 - Collins\nWho motivated me?\n00:14:11 - Collins\nTo take this path because at first I thought computer science.\n00:14:20 - Collins\nWas the best.\n00:14:22 - Collins\nBut after getting advice from a few friends who are ahead of me, I actually decided to settle in software engineering.\n00:14:34 - Killion\nWell, now I know.\n00:14:38 - Killion\nSo what are some of the sources of information that have actually helped you to make decisions around this choice?\n00:14:47 - Killion\nFor example, have you relied on guidance from school counselors or your family?\n00:14:53 - Killion\nOr the Internet or any other source?\n00:14:59 - Collins\nYeah, first of all.\n00:15:02 - Collins\nMy family has been a very, very great inspiration 'cause they keep on me being the first one exploring the field. They also want to learn more about me.\n00:15:14 - Collins\nAbout from me so that.\n00:15:16 - Collins\nKeeps me pushing.\n00:15:19 - Collins\nMuch so that when I go there and they ask me, can you help us with this? I actually find a way to help them and.\n00:15:29 - Collins\nSecondly.\n00:15:31 - Collins\nI am one of my lecturers.\n00:15:35 - Collins\nLesbian. Very, very great inspiration and has been supporting.\n00:15:40 - Collins\nThroughout my education, which makes me see myself.\n00:15:45 - Collins\nAt a good place in the future.\n00:15:48 - Killion\nWow, OK.\n00:15:49 - Killion\nWell, that sounds so.\n00:15:51 - Killion\nNow on to our last.\n00:15:52 - Killion\nKylian, I know you must have a battle between maybe wanting to know which is the best career to settle on, you know.\n00:16:02 - Killion\nEspecially after graduating from your school and after receiving your.\n00:16:06 - Killion\nYou know, perhaps you wanted to know is software really the best for me or is maybe medicine really the best course for me?\n00:16:15 - Killion\nI'm just interested in understanding if.\n00:16:19 - Killion\nYou faced any challenge or maybe uncertainties when making your career decisions and if that was so, how did you overcome them?\n00:16:31 - Collins\nYeah. Thank.\n00:16:32 - Collins\nSo first of all, when it came to choosing the career.\n00:16:39 - Collins\nI had quite a number of.\n00:16:43 - Collins\nAdequate number of courses to choose from because I was passionate about computing. But computing is very large so.\n00:16:53 - Collins\nAt first I didn't have the knowledge.\n00:16:58 - Collins\nWhat? Let's say it does.\n00:17:00 - Collins\nWhat's the difference between it information science and technology?\n00:17:05 - Collins\nWhat's the difference between software engineering and computer science?\n00:17:10 - Collins\nComputer science and applied computer science.\n00:17:13 - Collins\nSo it was somehow.\n00:17:17 - Collins\nAt first.\n00:17:19 - Collins\nA challenge, but after quite a good after quite.\n00:17:24 - Collins\nResearch and consultation from a few friends of my parents.\n00:17:33 - Collins\nMy high school teachers, I got to understand the difference between.\n00:17:39 - Collins\nEach and how each work, where they are applied.\n00:17:43 - Collins\nAnd that's when I came.\n00:17:46 - Collins\nTo my choice.\n00:17:48 - Killion\nWell, that's, that's interesting, that's.\n00:17:53 - Killion\nSo thank you so much for your time, Gillian. That's actually it.\n00:17:56 - Killion\nActually, the end of our survey.\n00:18:00 - Killion\nThank you for sharing your thoughts and your insights are very valuable towards our.\n\n"

        "content": "Audio file\nManuela interview.m4a\nTranscript\n\n00:00:02 - Manuela\nNobody.\n00:00:04 - Collins\nThank you so much, Manuela, for joining me today.\n00:00:09 - Collins\nWe appreciate your time. And before we begin, I just want to let you know that this is a short survey to understand the aspirations and motivations of African students.\n00:00:27 - Collins\nYeah. So your responses will be kept confidential and will only be used for research purposes.\n00:00:37 - Collins\nOur session should take approximately 10 minutes, and I'll be asking you some questions about your studies, your career goals, and the motivations behind your choices.\n00:00:50 - Collins\nSo feel free to answer as openly as you're comfortable with.\n00:01:00 - Collins\nAlright, so thank you. Let's start with a little introduction about yourself.\n00:01:03 - Collins\nYou may want to talk about your educational background.\n00:01:13 - Collins\nBasically, the program of study at university at the moment.\n00:01:22 - Manuela\nOK, my name is Manuela. I studied at...\n00:01:28 - Manuela\nI went to high school and got a...\n00:01:32 - Manuela\n...minus CKC.\n00:01:36 - Manuela\nAnd currently, I'm at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology.\n00:01:43 - Manuela\nI am studying quantity surveying.\n00:01:46 - Collins\nOh, wow.\n00:01:47 - Collins\nThank you for sharing that.\n00:01:50 - Collins\nI'll just move to our next question.\n00:01:54 - Collins\nI'm actually wondering if you could tell me about the schools or institutions that you've attended before joining JKUAT, and maybe how these schools have influenced your current educational path?\n00:02:11 - Manuela\nSo I attended my secondary school at Alliance Girls High School.\n00:02:16 - Manuela\nAt Alliance Girls, I took Art and Design, and Art and Design is one of the things that influenced my career choice.\n00:02:29 - Manuela\nWhen I entered Alliance Girls, I initially wanted to do medicine.\n00:02:37 - Manuela\nBut after interacting with students and teachers, especially in my art classes, I realized I wanted my course to involve something creative, and this was something I really liked.\n00:02:57 - Manuela\nAt the same time, I found myself being drawn to renovation and building and construction shows such as Amazing Engineering on National Geographic, and \"Europe From Above\" on Discovery Family.\n00:03:19 - Manuela\nThis really helped shape my decision.\n00:03:26 - Collins\nWell, I'm so glad to hear that you were inspired by your interactions and experiences. That’s very interesting! Let’s talk about your future now.\n00:03:41 - Collins\nI’d love to hear about your career aspirations. Could you mention your long-term career goals or the kind of work that you envision yourself doing after graduation?\n00:04:00 - Collins\nWhat is your vision for your future?\n00:04:03 - Manuela\nOK, so my course in quantity surveying is quite a wide field. It deals with building economics but can also work in a lot of fields since it's essentially about economics.\n00:04:18 - Manuela\nI plan to stay in the construction industry for around 10 or 20 years before eventually branching out to become an arts teacher at the secondary school level.\n00:04:45 - Manuela\nWhile doing my PhD to be able to lecture at any university.\n00:04:54 - Collins\nWell, that's so interesting! I really wish you well in your current and future endeavors. It's amazing to hear that you might want to be a lecturer in the future.\n00:05:04 - Collins\nHave your goals changed over time, or have you always been focused on this path?\n00:05:19 - Manuela\nMy goals did change over time. Initially, my mission was to stay in the corporate world, but I later discovered that the corporate world wasn’t exactly for me.\n00:05:37 - Manuela\nAs I continued to discover myself, I realized I have a passion for teaching art. I like gaining knowledge and sharing it.\n00:05:52 - Manuela\nSo I realized that eventually, I’d like to end up like my current mentor, Mrs. Karani, who was my art teacher in high school.\n00:06:01 - Manuela\nAnd that’s the path I plan to take.\n00:06:07 - Collins\nWow, that’s amazing! You’ve actually mentioned something that I was going to ask actually because I really want to understand the reason why you were making this career choice. Sorry.\n00:06:21 Collins:\nSo you've talked about mentor and?\n00:06:26 Collins:\nI'm wondering if the people in your life, such as your family, your friends, or mentors who have worked in a similar field, and if so, how did they influence your decisions?\n00:06:40 Manuela:\nSo my mentor is my high school teacher.\n00:06:44 Manuela:\nCalled Missus Kalani.\n00:06:46 Manuela:\nSo I met Missus Karani when we were in Form 1 and she guided me through art and after realizing I have the talent.\n00:06:55 Manuela:\nAnd she used to talk to us and advise on how and why.\n00:07:02 Manuela:\nWe use this art as a career subject, cause most of the time in Kenya, most of the career stem subjects are considered to be career subjects rather than art.\n00:07:17 Manuela:\nSo after she used to tell us which fields you can find yourself in, the most common field being architecture, but I...\n00:07:26 Manuela:\nDecided to go for quantity surveying since it had both art and mathematics elements.\n00:07:34 Manuela:\nWhile she also encouraged us to not only have one life goal.\n00:07:42 Manuela:\nSo as you can see, I'm aspiring to be both a QS and a teacher.\n00:07:47 Collins:\nYes.\n00:07:48 Manuela:\n'Cause you can find yourself in a lot of...\n00:07:50 Manuela:\nSo as much as I'm doing my degree in quantity surveying, I'm still out looking for...\n00:07:58 Manuela:\nA...\n00:07:59 Manuela:\nI'm still out looking for a lot more, mostly art-oriented.\n00:08:05 Manuela:\nYeah.\n00:08:08 Collins:\nWell, you have a very interesting story and passion, really for what you're doing and that is what is really needed.\n00:08:16 Collins:\nI think so.\n00:08:18 Collins:\nI just want to know if you have any stories that maybe shaped your inspirations in the space of quantity survey and art or teaching as you mentioned.\n00:08:31 Manuela:\nPardon.\n00:08:32 Collins:\nI'm wondering if you've encountered any stories that shaped your aspirations in the space that you currently in.\n00:08:41 Manuela:\nI have.\n00:08:42 Manuela:\nI have.\n00:08:45 Collins:\nWould you like to talk about it?\n00:08:49 Manuela:\nYeah. So the story that shaped how I got into quantity survey.\n00:08:53 Manuela:\nThank you.\n00:08:56 Manuela:\nSo as I told you, the most common field to get into as an artist in Kenya is architecture.\n00:09:04 Manuela:\nSo I actually checked how architectural courses are taught.\n00:09:12 Manuela:\nI interacted with a few architects and realized that as much as architecture is amazing.\n00:09:21 Manuela:\nThe process and the teaching kind of kills the artist in you.\n00:09:30 Manuela:\nSo I wanted a course that had art elements of architecture but still let me maintain being a fine artist.\n00:09:40 Manuela:\nSo with that, I found the middle ground to take quantity surveying.\n00:09:46 Manuela:\nSo the course actually, during our first two years of study, we study architecture, we study the buildings and everything involving architecture.\n00:09:56 Manuela:\nAnd then in the third year, we branched to mathematics.\n00:10:00 Manuela:\nSo this course takes four years, while architecture in Canada takes six years.\n00:10:05 Manuela:\nYes.\n00:10:06 Manuela:\nYes, yes. So with this.\n00:10:09 Manuela:\nI find myself having a head start.\n00:10:13 Manuela:\nIn the construction industry.\n00:10:17 Manuela:\nThen also having time to pursue fine art.\n00:10:21 Manuela:\nAnd the story that the story that shaped my wanting to be a teacher, and this is something I realized a bit later, this is actually not involved in art, but rather in my high school. I used to be the chemistry representative.\n00:10:35 Manuela:\nAnd due to unavoidable circumstances, I found myself teaching the class.\n00:10:44 Manuela:\nWhen the teacher was unavailable and covering a lot of the classes actually. So with this I realized I love.\n00:10:55 Manuela:\nI love the planning.\n00:10:57 Manuela:\nAnd actually reading ahead, learning the knowledge, planning and then finally sharing, I also realized I have a talent in sharing and guidance at the same time. We had our KCSC projects, we were doing some KCSC projects in.\n00:11:14 Manuela:\nHow, when, when was it?\n00:11:17 Manuela:\nIt was around three months before KCAC we officially start our ad projects and a lot of the students used to come to me for guidance when I know what, what is this Manila?\n00:11:28 Manuela:\nCan I improve?\n00:11:29 Manuela:\nHow can they sell this and they?\n00:11:31 Manuela:\nI found myself.\n00:11:32 Manuela:\nBeing a teacher, kind of.\n00:11:35 Manuela:\nIt was really interesting and I realized I really love noticing and sharing.\n00:11:41 Collins:\nHmm.\n00:11:42 Manuela:\nAnd the final story was actually my progress in art from how I got, I got to Form 1 and by the time I got to, by the time I got to Form 4.\n00:11:53 Manuela:\nMy art was amazing.\n00:11:56 Manuela:\nSo I had the talent.\n00:12:00 Manuela:\nBut the tips?\n00:12:01 Manuela:\nHad been shared in art class.\n00:12:04 Manuela:\nIs something I realized that this actually helps shape artists, and these are tips I used to get and I would love to share them with other people so that they can improve their art. Yeah.\n00:12:17 Collins:\nWell, I'm just so excited to listen to your, should I say, inspirational stories. I mean, they're just so.\n00:12:25 Collins:\nAnd maybe after this session, I'd like to engage more with you, because I also realize that you're someone who likes teaching other people.\n00:12:34 Collins:\nMaybe you may want to.\n00:12:36 Collins:\nAlso, teach me some little art after this session or some other time.\n00:12:41 Collins:\nThank you so much for sharing that.\n00:12:44 Collins:\nI'm just wondering if there's some sources of information that actually helped you to make decisions around.\n00:12:50 Collins:\nYour career choice, for example, you may want to talk about.\n00:12:54 Collins:\nMaybe getting guidance from your school counselors, or maybe your family.\n00:12:59 Collins:\nMaybe used to the?\n00:13:01 Collins:\nOr just any other sources that have helped you make a decision in this field.\n00:13:09 Manuela:\nYeah. So unfortunately there wasn't a lot of guidance from school in choosing our careers.\n00:13:16 Manuela:\nWe had a.\n00:13:17 Manuela:\nLot of career talks and these forms we had to.\n00:13:24 Manuela:\nKnow which career path you take, but.\n00:13:28 Manuela:\nThe career paths are usually very.\n00:13:30 Manuela:\nYou are either a doctor, a lawyer, an architect, or maybe a pilot.\n00:13:36 Collins:\nYeah.\n00:13:37 Manuela:\nSo you'd find that something like QS which is.\n00:13:41 Manuela:\nIt's not something that's very common or very known, so it's very hard to get into.\n00:13:46 Manuela:\nA career so my.\n00:13:49 Manuela:\nPlay.\n00:13:50 Manuela:\nYeah. So my influence was mostly from.\n00:13:53 Manuela:\nThe family and shows OK.\n00:13:56 Collins:\nYeah. Well, that's so great to hear.\n00:14:00 Collins:\nAnd now on to my last question.\n00:14:03 Collins:\nHave you faced any uncertainties? Because initially previously I think I had you mention something to do with wanting to be a medical doctor, getting to the medical space.\n00:14:16 Collins:\nAnd now?\n00:14:17 Collins:\nHere into the QS and you also want to.\n00:14:21 Collins:\nUAE in the field of art and now you want to be a teacher as well.\n00:14:27 Collins:\nDid you face any challenges or rather uncertainties when making this decision of settling into art and yeah.\n00:14:36 Manuela:\nI actually faced a lot of unsatisfactory.\n00:14:50 Manuela:\nYeah.\n00:14:52 Manuela:\nI had at first getting in Form 1 and being a bright student. The expectation was to be a doctor.\n00:15:03 Manuela:\nHey.\n00:15:03 Manuela:\nBut once I got there and studied and did biology, I realized this is not where I want to be.\n00:15:12 Manuela:\nYeah.\n00:15:14 Manuela:\nYeah, but.\n00:15:15 Manuela:\nWas still not very certain where I'm going.\n00:15:18 Manuela:\nCause architecture seemed like a.\n00:15:19 Manuela:\nWell, that was the film that seemed to be the closest option.\n00:15:23 Manuela:\nWhat I wanted mm.\n00:15:26 Manuela:\nSo between from 2:00 and from three, I was very uncertain on what I'm going to do, but luckily for me, I had a very supportive sister.\n00:15:35 Manuela:\nWe thought about we wrote down 5 courses, I don't remember.\n00:15:40 Manuela:\nWhich other courses we?\n00:15:42 Manuela:\nBut I remember quantity survey was among the courses we wrote.\n00:15:46 Manuela:\nAnd then I went and did.\n00:15:47 Manuela:\nOn which is which.\n00:15:49 Manuela:\nThank you.\n00:15:50 Manuela:\nBefore finally landing in quantity surveying. But this took a while and the years before I realized I wanted to be in the construction industry.\n00:16:01 Manuela:\nSo by the time I realized there was about, it was only four, four, and time. You were supposed to fill these forms.\n00:16:10 Manuela:\nFor your career, and I actually had to make a decision at that time.\n00:16:14 Manuela:\nStill wasn't sure whether this is.\n00:16:16 Manuela:\nWhere I want to be.\n00:16:19 Manuela:\nBut I feel as nonetheless.\n00:16:22 Manuela:\nAnd I'm I'm happy with my choice.\n00:16:25 Collins:\nWell, thank you so much for sharing such insightful thoughts, you know, and I'm just so excited that we are coming to the end of this and you shared just a lot, a lot of information.\n00:16:40 Collins:\nSo it's actually the end of our interview, or rather session and.\n\n"
